0,Recent update made it impossible to order anything from home anymore,False,2020-11-04 01:44:52,5,"I've been using door dash with dash pass for a few months, ordering for and with my girlfriend and family, occasionally with them paying. I support the drivers a lot as well, and I would order every day, giving generous tips and additional cash if I had it. But they just added another two factor authorization that doesn't work properly at all, and it ended in me wasting money on dash pass, on my account and my mom's account for literally no reason, and I guarantee it's causing a lot of dashers to lose money. So I called technical support and they sent me a troubleshooting list to start off with, and I followed it step by step, removing the cards, authorizing them one at a time, everything they said to do. Needless to say, their first branch of customer service was nothing short of a heaving pile of garbage. They said to wait snd try again later, so then comes the next day. I tried ordering food, with two cards with the same general info, and SHABAM, nothing happens. Well, not nothing, it repeatedly asks me to ""rescan your card"" even though it's been done and verified like 12 times and the useless payment from the dash pass on both accounts went through, but not the actual orders? The cards are obviously accepted and they work, so I called them again. They sent me to a slightly higher up in the branch, and she said, she can't do anything about it. So cool, you guy's lost literally 6 customers in one go üëçüèª",Tristan the angry man,
1,Wow! Horrible auto-response ...,False,2020-07-25 01:47:46,5,"I have been using Door Dash from day one.  I preferred Door Dash to Uber Eats, but there are constant issues of items missing, drivers leaving my order at other doors, drivers taking hours to deliver and if you order drinks forget about it.  I continued to patronize Door Dash regardless of the constant mishaps because at least their customer service reps are extremely polite and helpful. However, I recently ordered a rather large order ($70 as usual) band it was frustrating to receive the order again with no drinks. But when I went to report the missing item I received a most disappointing auto response that stated ‚ÄúThank you for bringing this to our attention. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide compensation on this order due to your account history.‚Äù So I guess if you continue to use Door Dash services and pay them for it although they continue to forget your items you paid for eventually you will reach a moment when Door Dash will be okay with taking your money and not delivering your food... just taking your money. The rep Vincent quickly apologized and offered a refund for the missing drink, however the auto response is apparently the type of business Door Dash intends to conduct which is to take your money and provide shady service then refuse to right their mistakes unless you take time out of your day to argue with them about it. No thanks. I‚Äôll be taking my business elsewhere.",Loyal-Patron,
2,Great app if you want to waste your money and time :),False,2021-06-05 04:19:09,5,"On multiple occasions I have had issues with doordash across different states, restaurant, time of order placed, the issue is clearly with doordash and the dashers themselves. I‚Äôve had dashers deliver food to the entirely wrong apartment and swear up and down they delivered it to the right apartment even if the delivery photo clearly shows a different apartment number. I‚Äôve had orders missing food many times, I once had a order from chipotle where I ordered a steak bowl with rice, beans, the works, and they literally gave me lettuce and meat with nothing else with the excuse their doordash system never send the orders to them correctly. I‚Äôve had orders with ‚Äòtechnical difficulties‚Äô get cancelled an hour after I placed the order and got all the confirmation notifications saying ‚Äòorder confirmed by ___‚Äô ‚Äòorder being prepped by kitchen‚Äô only for doordash to turn around and claim ‚Äòtechnical difficulties‚Äô and tell me ‚Äòplace another order at a different restaurant‚Äô as if by that time most restaurants had closed. All around a horrible app and a waste of time and money. Customer support is awful and half the time doesn‚Äôt even reply back, or will refund you $1 for a missing item that cost $10. Best bet I reccomend uber eats or literally any other app.",Yejinnie,
3,Whatever,False,2021-11-15 23:54:46,3,"I guess i can fix all my problems if i wasn‚Äôt so lazy and just went and got food myself. BUT, it‚Äôs frustrating that you offer a service to people  and aren‚Äôt consistent. 

First off, everything is wildly more expensive, i don‚Äôt know it that‚Äôs doordash‚Äôs fault or not. I also can‚Äôt explain the frustration when i order food when i entertain guests, and my order gets grouped with another order and takes about 45-60 minutes longer. And i legit get MAD when my house is obviously closer to the driver than the other destination but they still go there first and drive all the way back to where they were in the first place to drop off my order. Why can‚Äôt the drivers use their own basic intuition?? 

The app itself is infuriating. I live in an apartment complex and when i type my address, it puts the pin in the completely wrong spot. I then move the pin, and add delivery instructions, but as soon as the dasher is on their way the app deletes all the information i just put. Although it seems like the drivers still see the delivery instructions. I just really wish the pin feature would work, because doordash drivers are, for whatever reason, completely incapable of finding my apartment. They leave my food at the completely wrong place, and just leave. Can‚Äôt even call to confirm?? Or even text??? Obviously it‚Äôs the wrong place. I have to go hunt it down wherever these Einstein‚Äôs think the delivery instructions say? It‚Äôs crazy. Idk what to expect though. So, whatever",kdawg7653,
4,Address issues,False,2021-11-06 22:38:29,3,"I enjoy the DoorDash app very much. I‚Äôve been using it more than other food delivery apps. Ordering is simple and easy and many Dashers are friendly and professional from my experiences. The reason why I‚Äôm giving it 3 stars is that there seems to be some strange issue with my address on the app. Now I can‚Äôt speak for everyone else cause this might not be a problem for others but for me, it‚Äôs becoming a big issue. 

I live in a mobile home park and similar to apartments, we have Lot numbers specific to our mobile homes. I put all of the necessary credentials in for my address. I add my Lot number to the apt/suite spot. Everything‚Äôs there. However, for some unknown reason, the Lot number does not show up on the address and this has been confusing some of the dashers delivering to me. Now, most of the dashers end up finding me (though, some of them had to circle the neighborhood a few times or will call or text just to get additional information to help find me) but there have been times where my food was not delivered to the right place and this has happened more than twice (too many times to be honest‚Ä¶).

I find it strange that my Lot number does not show for my address during these deliveries. It only makes things difficult for me and the dasher. I hope this gets fixed because this is becoming too much of a hassle for me to add extra instructions just to help my dashers when something simple as a ‚ÄúLOT NUMBER‚Äù can easily fix this problem‚Ä¶",Gregory J W.,
5,Really Poor Communication/Instruction Following,False,2021-04-22 12:17:20,2,"I‚Äôve been using door dash for close to two years now and lately, I don‚Äôt know what it is, but no one knows how to deliver food lol. The past four times I‚Äôve ordered from them, there‚Äôs been a problem. Instructions for the food itself not followed, instructions for the dasher not followed, etc. I‚Äôve had to have food redelivered twice in the past week because of the dasher. The first time, they dropped it off at a neighbors house way down the street, and luckily they called me so I went to grab my food. On the days I order food at work in the morning, I ask that the dasher text me when they get here, as we‚Äôre closed when I order food, and the past few times I haven‚Äôt had anyone text me which door they left the food at. Today, I straight up didn‚Äôt get my food. I texted my dasher and asked where she left my food, and got no response. I checked the front and back doors, and the neighboring businesses, and my food wasn‚Äôt there, so I had to have it redelivered again. It‚Äôs just really frustrating and I feel like door dash thinks I‚Äôm just trying to get free food because I‚Äôve had so many problems lately üò≠ And I feel like a jerk even saying this but I tip really well because I know dashers don‚Äôt get paid super well and depend on tips, but I‚Äôm tired of having to tip close to $10 for someone who isn‚Äôt going to follow my instructions or even like... bring me my food lol. I have issues like this every once in a while, but never to this extent.",Sjbusam12,
6,Jim from Gainesville Florida,False,2021-10-05 17:12:21,4,"I scored this app really high because the app makes it very easy for people who do not drive to be able to appreciate the different stores businesses and restaurants and others in our community. I‚Äôve also used the DoorDash out of state, and in other localities around Florida. My only concern is that number one they closed their ADA or assistance for people disabilities line and that is kind of challenging. When I need to get help with something. Also when updates happen frequently I find that I have to call customer service and work with someone who is definitely interested in helping but may not always have strong English skills. So we spend a lot of the call explaining what the problem is and how it might affect the blind community especially uses this app and I would hope that you would work more closely with the organizations American Council of the blind national Federation of the blind and their affiliates that work with technology do you continue to make this app even more accessible and inclusive. I gave you a four. But please know that if you are able to fix some of these loose ends and be a little more inclusive of your body visually impaired and reading customers I will review five stars. Thanks for a great app let‚Äôs just make it just a little bit better. I‚Äôm dictating this so please forgive any errors.",Jim from Gainesville FL,
7,Good App. Good Service. Good Money Grab.,False,2021-01-01 20:58:52,3,"I find that the app itself is easy enough to use for any of my food orders. However the pricing is a bit high just to have some food delivered. I‚Äôm talking about the delivery, and service fees. They offer free delivery on certain orders, from certain restaurants, except the service fee will then be higher. It‚Äôs just quite a leap in price from picking something up, to having it delivered through Door-Dash. I get that it‚Äôs meant to be convenient. However, something stops being convenient when it becomes quite a bit more expensive. Then they say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just sign up for our Door Pass‚Äù and you‚Äôll get free deliveries, except again, those services fees are tricky. Not to mention, you‚Äôre now paying $9.99 a month for something you only use like once or twice a month. It just doesn‚Äôt make much sense unless your ordering food delivered several times a week, but even then with the service charges and tips added, you might as well drive the 5 minutes (2miles) and pick it up yourself. These Apps in a way take advantage of  elderly people, and sick people who can‚Äôt leave their homes due to isolation, quarantine, or the fear of getting sick and who have no family or friends to help them. They have no choice but to spend the extra money to use these apps so they can eat. Which is not great in a time where a majority of people are financially struggling. End review rant.",ANTMAN489,
8,Doordash even stole Keys. Doordash doesn‚Äôt hold their Enployees Accountable,False,2020-03-29 22:09:24,4,"Although I made a huge unfortunate mistake of leaving my keys in the door after getting home from work, tired, with handful of things, my doordasher violated me. The doordasher stole my keys!!!!!! As soon as he arrived we heard him remove the keys from the door, knock, then run. After opening our door we found our food sitting on our mat, as we had prompted for no contact. When realizing he took our keys we submitting a complaint to doordash as well as submitting a police report. The detective assigned to the case contacted doordash hoping to communicate with the dasher, however doordash will not release his information. Understandably, I get wanting to protect the employee, but I don‚Äôt understand not diligently working to make sure the issue at hand is resolved nor happens again. If they have not fired that dasher, they inevitably have a thieving employee ready to prey on the next customer. ADDITIONALLY, we learned that doordash is too unreliable when two days later we received the complete wrong order, we tried to immediately contact the dasher to inform her we had the wrong order and she was potentially delivering another wrong order, but doordash had blocked the number already. Although we received credit for the inconvenience we have learned that trusting doordash is far too much of a stretch for us.",Funfun2.0,
9,Worst delivery and customer service ever!!Do not use!!,False,2021-03-03 00:50:07,5,"I have been a frequent door dash user and over the last month there customer service and service has been an absolute nightmare! The last 6 orders I've had with them have all been missing main entrees, sides and orders as well as items being made incorrectly even though I specify exactly what I ordered which I understand it's food service but when you haven't ate dinner an you order food you expect to receive the food you ordered and if you do not then I expect either for the order be corrected or a refund but after calling this last time because my order was missing 5things and the rest was made wrong. This order was 40 bucks for taco bell and when I got in touch with customers service they were rude and said that I have reached my limit on refunds. Which makes no since I didnt have to have a refund I just wanted what I paid for and if that's not possible then I wanted a refund for it and they stated they couldn't do wither and that there was no supervisor and no help at all. Deanna was the customer supports name and she was horrible. I refuse to pay for something I did not receive!! That's theft basically this is ridiculous an I will never us this service again!!",gzitsstistii,
10,Love DoorDash‚Ä¶but MANY order issues,False,2021-09-11 00:05:00,3,"1st, let me say, I do LOVE DoorDash. Very convenient, especially during this never ending Covid pandemic. I am immunocompromised & have to take immune suppressing drugs daily due to a rare condition..and I live in a state with 1 of the lowest vaccination rates..and I live less than 30 minutes from 1 of our state‚Äôs ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù so..very helpful for me. DoorDash customer service is awesome. Most of the drivers I‚Äôve encountered are super nice. So why the 3 stars right? I would estimate that 1 out of every 3 orders I place has an issue. I haven‚Äôt used the app in many months because 5 (FIVE!!) orders in a row had issues! Not minor issues either‚Ä¶items left out, items substituted (without contacting me and/or confirming I was ok with it), food completely wrong, etc). And I‚Äôm often ordering for my 6 yr old, who has a sensory disorder/ADHD/anxiety/dyspraxia so she often gets upset and..it‚Äôs just frustrating because it‚Äôs all completely avoidable IMO. As I said, customer service is wonderful & helps resolve issues..but I‚Äôm still left without the items I needed/wanted, still have to get them & also take the time to get in touch with customer service & work on a resolution. Who really wants to do all of that more often than not when ordering?? I would truthfully use another service if one was available in my area. Just to avoid the hassle.

11,Assignment of Dashers,False,2020-10-15 01:16:46,3,"I‚Äôm not sure how this works, but I‚Äôve faced this issue innumerable times. So my user journey is - I check out the food/restaurant on doordash -> order food from the resto  -> order is placed -> money deducted (all good till here) -> I see an ETA -> And now a dasher is assigned (which I see)  -> So the dasher makes it a point to not pay heed to the ETA and bring food anytime after that. I am a human and I crave food when hungry. And that is why app like Doordash exist because of the craving and the ease to answer my craving. And when that is not satisfied, trouble begins and I write a review. So my problem is 1.) How come dashers change mid-way : is it like they bring food and in mid-way ‚ÄòTony (namesake, the dasher who was assigned)‚Äô met ‚ÄòFrank(new dasher)‚Äô and they exchanged my food mid way and now Frank comes. 2.) Many times I receive my food cold. Why? If the taxes are not sufficient increase them but bring my food ‚Äòhot‚Äô. Please. 3.) The dashers are always assigned to multiple pick-ups and no wonder food turns up cold - kindly make an algorithm so that a dasher pertains to not more than ‚Äò3‚Äô orders else the customer has to eat stone-cold food. 4.) Tips - I earlier used to give them, but once I started receiving stone cold food I stopped and I am afraid what else can I do. I want convenience and thanks to you I am getting that but not at the cost of delayed and cold food. Apologies but I should have voiced this out earlier.",DSR17,
12,They‚Äôll steal your money,False,2022-05-27 13:21:11,1,I was a consistent user of door dash for a while and I paid for the dash pass monthly. I made an order on DoorDash and the wait time on the order was over an hour so I proceeded to cancel my order and asked to have the money refunded to my card and the wait was going to be roughly three days. I was instructed to contact my bank if I didn‚Äôt see the funds after three days. Three days pass and I‚Äôm still waiting for my money to come back into my account so I contacted my bank and they tell me that there is no record of door dash attempting to refund my money. So I then proceeded to contact door dash and this time they tell me repeatedly that they issued a ‚Äúrefund‚Äù but I would not see any money return to my account??? After wasting my breath I finally agreed to take my refund in door dash credit. A couple days later I decided to use the credit issued to my account and made an order. I received my order and was missing 5 items from my order and when I attempted to report this issue to door dash I was immediately told that because I used credit they couldn‚Äôt do anything. I open the customer support chat and was told that because of the previous issue with my account they could do nothing to fix my order. So basically i spend money every month for a ‚Äúpremium subscription‚Äù to door dash and then I spent two weeks trying to get my money back from door dash just to have it stolen again and then be told that I can‚Äôt have my money or my food.,Mer Lefty,
13,Information Stolen,False,2021-09-12 18:06:49,1,"My DoorDash account was somehow hacked. The person stole my credit card/bank information and ordered nearly $80 of food. They were in the middle of making a $100+ order when I locked my card. I managed to get the first order cancelled before the food was picked up, but DoorDash was offering only $44 as a refund with a credit of $17 on my next order. I‚Äôm a broke college student, so every cent counts.

They kept ignoring when I said it wasn‚Äôt me just changing my mind and cancelling my order. I had to literally beg a representative for the full refund. I haven‚Äôt received it yet. I know it‚Äôs only been a couple days and it takes time to process, but I currently have no money to pay for food or medication I HAVE to have, especially not with a compromised card. I‚Äôm thankful I have caring friends that are trying their hardest to help me (they are also broke), but there is obviously a serious privacy/security issue. I had not used my card for anything or anywhere in the area since moving into the dorm as I was saving up to do a much needed grocery shop, and it was not linked to any other app. 

I really really hope no one else has to experience this. It‚Äôs extremely stressful and I‚Äôve been on the phone with my bank trying to secure my account and get reimbursed, which can‚Äôt happen until DoorDash completes the refund. If you‚Äôre gonna use the app, PLEASE watch your bank account closely for any unauthorized charges. You might not be able to get your money back.",amadeuswolfie,
14,Dasher dropped my food off at the wrong addressüò°,False,2021-08-12 00:46:59,3,"I ordered seafood from this known restaurant that was maybe 15mins away for my kids while I was at work. When I seen the dasher getting close I called them to tell them to be standing outside, he‚Äôs about to pull up. Well I got a picture text from the dasher handing my food to a man that clearly wasn‚Äôt my kids. I called my kids asked did they see anyone outside because he just gave the food to someone, they said NO so I immediately hurried and called the driver. He proceeded to tell me he was at the right address so I told him no sir my kids are standing outside he said well I gave it to a older man I asked could he go knock on the door because he gave my food to the wrong family. This man hung up in my face then would not answer my calls!!! I was so furious. 

I made a complaint and Door Dash took no time reaching back out to me only to find out that he in fact did drop my food off at the wrong location. Door Dash refunded me my money back which will take of course 5-7 days but they are the reason I gave 3 stars because of customer service being so excellent. 

As far as the driver I wish I could write a individual review about him. That was just plain unacceptable. Door dash need to add the feature where you can track the driver. If they have it, I‚Äôm behind on trying to figure out how to do it. Do better Dashers!!",DesereyNicole88,
15,Dash pass is not worth it/ poor policies and too many screw ups,False,2022-08-28 03:52:47,1,"I constantly have problems with my order and late deliveries. Door dash actually has a policy that they won‚Äôt compensate you for their mistakes if it happens to you too many times and trust me if you subscribe and use your dash pass, you will encounter an absurd amount of problems. I regularly have missing items or food that arrived extraordinarily late and I‚Äôve had food that didn‚Äôt show up at all and was marked as delivered. Today the order I placed at a fast food restaurant at 5 o clock took almost two hours to arrive, it was finally delivered at 6:45 cold and soggy. When I called door dash about the problem they offered me LESS than the cost of my order for the issue. I did not pay for two hour old soggy food. They finally offered me a ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù of the $9 they offered me on my $17 order plus an additional $10. Food prices are marked up and that extra money goes in doordashes pocket as well as the dash pash and any fees. You‚Äôre paying a lot of extra money for this service and they don‚Äôt take responsibility for their errors. In fact, after monitoring this most recent delivery i believe they had my food just sitting around in the dashers possession while they attempted to monopolize on other orders as my food got cold while waiting for over an hour to be delivered. I won‚Äôt be renewing again especially after being informed I shouldn‚Äôt get fully compensated for my cold soggy two hour late food.",Lauraloo91,
16,Malfunction in the process,False,2021-07-16 17:03:23,1,"Not thrilled that most recently I placed an order and we waited for about an hour and 15 minutes before I had to finally reach out and find out where our order was. I spoke with the driver who told me that he was in Dover which is a good half hour away from us. He said he showed up to the restaurants address that door dash gave him and that there was no restaurant there. So he advised he was going to contact door Dash and then get back to me. I never heard back from him, what I did get was an email from door Dash apologizing but my order had been canceled. When I contacted door Dash they told me that sometimes the restaurant will cancel the order because they are too busy. That makes sense. However these two stories don‚Äôt match, The driver is telling me one story and door dash is telling me another. I would assume if the restaurant is not taking any additional orders that they would have the ability to turn off door Dash prior to someone either a going through the time to make the order or b waiting for the door dash driver to arrive. I also didn‚Äôt understand that after the mistake was made it was still showing as though I could order through subway on the app??? Why would they still leave it up if it‚Äôs not an option?
Not really sure what happened this is the first time we‚Äôve ever had a problem with door Dash but I can tell you this much it was definitely not handle the way that I would expect to have been handled.",Ani08-123456789,
17,Good (overall),False,2022-04-27 02:06:17,5,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for certain foods and those who prep it. It has been said that ‚Äúanyone can cook‚Äù. But I realize, only now do I truly understand what those meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking around the world.

18,Door dash scams with driver tax fee ontop of delivery tip,False,2021-09-20 20:47:35,1,"I ordered on door dash and everything came but I noticed something on door dash and that was that door dash charged me for a delivery fee before paying the drivers delivery tip. The delivery fee was 8 dollars. I'm fair with my delivery drivers, so I give them a 10 dollar delivery tip. So that means I'm paying 18 dollars for delivery on a fast food meal. But the problem I had is that if I'm paying double for deliveries then is door dash paying its drivers? Well it turns out they are and I'm paying for an extra delivery fee on a fast food order. So I reached out to customer service at door dash and asked if they paid their drivers and they said they do. So I asked why am I being charged twice then when I pay. She wouldn't answer the question and tried to bribe me to get rid of me. I could care less about the refund. I just wanted answers. Well she wouldn't give me any and ontop of that she said she was only giving me a refund because she felt guilty. I just wanted to let people know that door dash and rally's are using scummy tactics to increase their profits. This order was with rally‚Äôs so I‚Äôve included them in this cause it would be an incomplete story without it. Also: Rallys prices are higher on door dash than at the restaurant Rally's menu is limited because those items don't sell as well as others at rally's over other menu items.

19,Don‚Äôt bother with delivery,False,2021-02-21 01:40:23,1,"My first few orders with DashPass were great (faster than expected delivery time and food was always hot). Then I had the occasional order delays. This has progressed to food being marked as delivered when it wasn‚Äôt. Most recently, the dasher picked up my meal, the app indicated the driver was one minute away and then the map began updating to show the driver further and further away, driving in circles. I assumed the driver was lost (no message about completing another delivery as had observed previously) and tried to message that I was available to provide directions. Then the driver got on a state highway and drove out of the city. The app updated to say the driver was at most 7 minutes away, but realistically they were at least 20. The driver had possession of my meal for over half an hour at this point. Then began the nightmare of trying to get the delivery canceled. When I finally got a hold of a customer service rep, they said the driver was completing another order first. I can see completing an order that adds 5-10 minutes and is within a reasonable geographic zone but not adding over half an hour. This is the opposite of quality assurance and I would consider this to be a potential public health issue.

I was able to reorder, walk to the restaurant and home before the dasher would have made it back into the city after dealing with customer service. DashPass is fine for order and pickup. Don‚Äôt waste your money on their delivery fees.",WhyMMM,

I have been using Uber eats religiously ever since. Tonight, I was in the mood for chili‚Äôs, which only door dash offers delivery for. I REGRET IT. Why did I ignore my past experiences and give DoorDash another chance?! I am so mad at myself. LISTEN TO THIS: I ordered my food around 9:00 pm. An HOUR later, a driver finally decides to take the order. HE COMES FROM A CITY 25-30 minutes AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. The food arrived at 11:00 pm. COLD AND SOGGY. Not only was the food late but I PAID FOR PRIORITY DELIVERY AND THE DRIVER MADE TWO STOPS BEFORE MINE! Not one, but TWO STOPS. I contact customer service and after spending 40 dollars on food, they offer 13 dollars refund and 5 dollars ‚Äúcredit‚Äù. I paid for the food, I paid for the delivery fee, the tax, the maintenance fee, and the TIP. And all you can offer in return is 5 dollars credit? Door dash charges 7-8 dollars in alone in fees. That 5 dollar ‚Äúcredit‚Äù won‚Äôt even cover the fees. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. I think it‚Äôs horrible that I paid with my hard earned cash for a service that is mediocre.

There isn‚Äôt even a comment section to give feedback on the dashers because I know a few have eaten some of my food while delivering it to me.

Not only is there no option to actually add a your favorite, there‚Äôs no way to remove them from the section. Every time I go to ‚Äúyour favorites‚Äù that place is always the first in line which is also very irritating. If a restaurant is closed on a day you look for it, it shows up as ‚Äúno result‚Äù even though I can go through my previous orders and find it that way. I will say I am appreciative of how responsive the support team is if the restaurant messes up, or the driver hands off the my food to someone else. They are quick with a refund, but they don‚Äôt refund your tip even if the driver doesn‚Äôt do what he is being paid to do.

22,Delivery drivers don‚Äôt ever follow instructions,False,2021-02-28 02:37:15,1,"Every time I have ordered, I have put in the instructions to not knock or ring the doorbell, and to just leave it at the doorstep (you get a notification once they mark they dropped it off anyway), but they bang on the door or ring the doorbell when they drop it off anyway.

Today I ordered food to my new place, which is a basement apartment accessed from the back yard. I explicitly said in both my address and in my order instructions that my door is on the back side of the house (which has a very clear and obvious path around it), and instructed them not to knock or ring the doorbell. Anticipating the same instruction ignorance issue as previous orders, I even sent a message through the app to the driver to tell them to bring it around the back. Lo and behold when my order arrived, the driver ignored both of my instructions and my message and rang the doorbell of the front door.

This is incredibly stupid because I am assigning the tip before the order comes by the design of the app. I am happy to give a good rip for good service, but there is no recourse or accountability for the delivery driver to follow any instructions, because their tip is guaranteed. If I am giving a tip and I put instructions down, and I‚Äôm not asking for anything irrational (literally just bring it to the correct door and don‚Äôt knock), those instructions should be followed. It isn‚Äôt hard. Not one of my drivers has followed instructions. It‚Äôs absurd.",goodbenjamin,
23,Horrible feedback. Unprofessional drivers and support,False,2019-03-25 10:55:33,5,My experience through this app has been disastrous. I have two young children and only one vehicle that my wife takes to work each day. Unfortunately the one or two times I order through this app I have received the worse service I have ever received anywhere. Both times my driver accepted the order that I had placed which therefore gave permission to the restaurant to cook my food. Both times my driver decided to not leave there current location for over an hour each time. If I had accepted the food it would have been cooked two hours before I would have received it. Another driver threatened to spit in my food when I asked how long it would take after waiting an hour. (Wait time stated 20-30 mins) and seeing that this person had not even left there house to get my food until after an hour after it was made.  Now I have to deal with this person having my address. After all the wasted time and all the grievance customer support can‚Äôt even offer free delivery for my troubles. They say your money will be back in my account in three to five days. My claim with a disgruntled driver was closed without any feedback. Money hungry company who does not care for there customers.,Hkeyes808,
24,Customers are valued,False,2022-01-17 02:14:11,1,"I‚Äôm gonna start with that I have a $50 credit for a week for year as an incentive from my employer.  Now with that being said, there are times my family of 4 has gone over the credit limit and therefor I use my credit card for the remaining balance.  In November I made a door dash order and ended up paying about $15 more than the credit.  When I received my order I realized there was a lot of food that was missing.  So I called the dasher who explained she just picked up what the restaurant had on the shelf under my name.  So I call the establishment and asked why I didn‚Äôt get everything and they said because they were out of a lot of food, I said ok then I can get a refund for the food I bought but never received and the manager said to contact door dash.  So since the end of November until last week, I was being told I‚Äôd have my refund within 7-10 days, never got it so I would contact a few more times and this last time I was able to get ahold of door dash, they stated they could not refund me my money due to their policy and procedures.  So I paid for food and never got the food or a refund.  I even told them I‚Äôd be ok with a credit on my account and they said sorry for this particular order we can not do that.  I‚Äôve tried to reach door dash to get a better understanding and now I get nothing.

25,Great customer service,False,2021-10-18 00:53:18,3,"Cons: Some Dashers lie and steal the food. A lot of my orders are wrong despite my instructions. Sometimes DoorDash won‚Äôt reimburse you if your order is incorrect which isn‚Äôt fair because this happens quite often. Pros: Customer service is excellent for the most part. They do what they can to rectify any issues. DashPass is great if you‚Äôre a frequent user. Suggestion: Better protocols for incorrect or missing items. I shouldn‚Äôt be treated like a liar because the restaurant got my order wrong. I‚Äôm not sure how you discipline rogue Dashers but I hope they lost their job. I‚Äôd have several instances where people take off with my food and I‚Äôm not ok with that even if I get the refund. I‚Äôve wasted hours of my time, waiting for my food. Something should be done about that. All in all, DoorDash is ok. I prefer to cook at home at this point because all these apps seem to be a waste of money, time, and unnecessary stress.

Update: DoorDash sent me an email stating that my review of a restaurant went against their community guidelines. Say what? All I say was, ‚ÄúMy pizza was undone in the middle and I was disappointed.‚Äù At this point, I will no longer be using DoorDash.

not many complaints at all, out of all of the delivery apps ive used this one is by far the best, there will always be complications with everything. 
all the drivers ive had have been great, unlike postmates and uber eats, so yea, go with door dash!!

If there is an issue with your food there is no way to get it fixed, so if you have no transportation or any other food available your out of luck. There is no way to provide feedback on restaurants or drivers to hold them accountable. For example, I had an order canceled 30 min after I placed it even though it said it would be arriving within 12-18 minutes, I had gotten home late from work so ordered that way so I could take care of things at the house, eat and go to bed, instead I‚Äôm up an hour and a half later due to no notification. I should be able to put a review on that restaurant so that others are aware of their unreliability. Another restaurant never reads special instructions, so first off, I get food I won‚Äôt eat and will only get a partial refund, um, no, I should get a full refund for the cost of the food at least. I should also be able to put a review on that restaurant so customers know they have to call the restaurant if they have special instructions and want them followed. Not to mention the driver that drove up in my YARD instead of my driveway! I mean, come on!!! The only thing you can put is driver is unprofessional ... seriously?

28,App Failed & the Worst Customer Support Ever!,False,2019-04-25 02:48:20,1,"I used the app and was able to order food when traveling. The second time when ordering at work it did not process so I tried to submit again and it told me my account was deactivated. I reached out to support to find out what happened as my credit card is in good standing. Support sent me an email saying they would look into it. A week later I followed up to see if there was any resolution which they replied back with a link to their legal terms page and said I had violated their terms. THAT WAS IT. That was their customer service response to their app failing during normal use. 
I even checked with my credit card company which told me they had not denied any transactions from DoorDash and my card was still active and valid. I also tried to place an order using a different email address to see if I could still order and it came back as account deactivated most likely since I used the same credit card. So that was my experience with the worst customer service and app fail. Their app failed and their response was THAT I VIOLATED their terms during normal use of placing a lunch order. I find it so funny. They could‚Äôve replied with a different response to discover what error may be happening with their service and chose to place the blame on me.

The only way to contact them was email so I was never fully refunded because you can't get in touch with anyone.. My order was $40 and they would only refund me $14! Then tonight was my second order. I figured it's been a year maybe they worked out the stupid issues they have. NOPE!! Tonight my food just never came! I went to the chat box in the app and I was in line behind over 2000 other people! Since I never received a refund on my first order I was going to wait to chat with someone. That never happened! Over 3 hours waiting.. I got down to # 124 in line.. and the chat just closes and my order in the app disappears. So I go and check my email and see that they have sent me a message 2 hours after my order should have arrived.. saying that my order has been canceled and I would be refunded in 3-5 days.. No reason as to what the heck happened or even a simple apology. At least I am getting a refund this time. I'll believe that when I see it! Doordash you are the worst!! Also I am a restaurant GM  and you have contacted me before to use your service. After giving you two chances it is clear you do not care at all about the customer.

However for a good amount of time now I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble with dashers. Many of them are on their own time schedule and see the delivery times more as suggestions than the time the food should be there. I‚Äôve waited over half an hour past the estimated delivery time and because of that had nothing to eat during my lunch break at work. The most frustrating thing I‚Äôve experienced on this app is that drivers now can pick up other orders ‚Äúin the area‚Äù of your order, and even if your order was the first picked up they‚Äôll take it on a ride to their other delivery(s) while your food gets nice and cold for you. Also, the good majority of restaurants that I‚Äôve seen on here do not take special instructions at all. This means that, for example, if you want extra sour cream on something but they don‚Äôt specifically have an option for it to be selected as an add on to the item, you‚Äôre just out of luck. This can be very disappointing and I‚Äôve not ordered things and gone and grabbed it myself because of this.

36,App and service needs changing,False,2021-06-23 19:07:00,2,"DoorDash‚Äôs service is quite frustrating If i am honest. I have used it five times and each time there has been a serious issue. The first two times I ordered something, I wasn‚Äôt notified of the food being picked up or the order being processed until I got a call and hour later by an angry driver who had been waiting outside. I was then met with only half of my order, I contacted the driver (no response) and customer service, who gave me a $3 credit for a $40 order. 

The other three times the order times for the food took twice as long as they were supposed to. Now this may have been due to busy restaurants or whatever, but again the app once I order gets stuck on ‚Äúprocessing your order‚Äù and I have no idea what the true update is. These other three times I was in contact with a representative who kept apologizing and trying to give me credits and cancel the order after I had waited for two hours.

37,Overcharging Menu Prices,False,2019-04-01 05:10:53,2,"My experience with DoorDash was going fairly well during my 30-day free trial of no delivery fees. I was aware of the higher fees for service, but thought that the menu prices for each restaurant did always seem rather high. It wasn‚Äôt until my most recent and last order that I discovered DoorDash sets and charges the menu prices that they see fit for each restaurant. 

When I received my order from a very friendly Dasher, she made a comment that I got a bargain for my order. I asked how so, and she responded because it was only $14. Only however, I paid $35 for my food, tax, service fee, and dasher tip ($5.60). (I was waived delivery fee during my trial) Therefore, for the food and tax I paid roughly $25. How did the dasher only pay $14 for the food when I paid for $25? (Before service fee and tip). DoorDash is over charging menu items. I found this out first hand, and by a customer service rep slipping up over the phone.

The company already charges for deliver fees and service fees, how is it that they also inflate the menu prices?! Customer service somewhat solved the issue, but if I had not of called to correct it, the company would have more money in their pockets. There was also no receipt in my bag, so if that Dasher had never mentioned how much she paid, I would have never known.

Another thirty minutes go by, I call the restaurant, they tell me the food was picked up to be delivered so I have to call DoorDash support. Food‚Äôs over half an hour late at this point.

43,Horrible service,False,2021-02-07 19:30:58,1,"I wouldn‚Äôt have issues with this app if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that 80% of my orders are always wrong.  I have had someone else‚Äôs order delivered to my door, drinks or desserts completely forgotten, over an hour of waiting for delivery only to have my food cold when it get to me.  Drivers are super unfriendly and don‚Äôt dive a sh**, probably because they don‚Äôt hold their drivers accountable.  It‚Äôs not worth the $10 a month for premium service and the fees.  You‚Äôre just better off getting in your car and getting it yourself.  At least this way if your order is wrong you can correct it in the moment.  Rather than sit and stew in anger and frustration while you complain to door dash to refund your money in credits.  Then you‚Äôll have to wait another 30-45 minutes to reorder and have your food delivered hopefully correctly.  I have had multiple times where I have ordered food, it‚Äôs delivered wrong or missing things, get my money credited back, order again, then it‚Äôs delivered wrong again.  

This could be a great service if drivers and food establishments were held accountable for their mistakes but they aren‚Äôt because everyone is using the app and who cares because DoorDash is probably making bank in a COVID world.  I have removed my dash pass and will no longer support this garbage service. Sure getting my own food is slightly inconvenient but I won‚Äôt be wasting anymore of my money.",miniSCHOF,
44,It‚Äôs a mess,False,2020-08-29 13:54:27,2,"Customer service was amazing so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll start.  With the good news.  The bad news for me is that the fees are not clear and expensive. There is also a ‚Äúdelivery fee‚Äù but then also a tip.  I don‚Äôt understand how that makes sense.  If you just paid your drivers the money they deserve it wouldn‚Äôt be on me to cover the cost. I know you make money off each order and with the way deals can be structured there‚Äôs all kinds of money you guys get per transaction.  I‚Äôm not saying this operation doesn‚Äôt deserve to make money. Obviously the inventor needs his cut and I‚Äôm happy to oblige. But too much of the weight is carried by the worker and that‚Äôs ridiculous when my tip is a huge part of how they can afford to live. Ultimate this side hustle culture can‚Äôt sustain its self and these types of outfits can‚Äôt last under the pressure of time. 

Pay your employees better and stop making the consumer pay their wages. I‚Äôm positive this company could survive if they did it and it‚Äôs a testament to the world we live in that I have to call 3 times to get extra fees taken off my card when the only reason I used this app was for a free order from an e-mail I received.   I never got the free order and only was given 5 dollars to compensate.  Hey it‚Äôs more than nothing but it‚Äôs a far cry from what I was promised.  If I could leave work for lunch I‚Äôd happily go get the food myself and that‚Äôs the only reason I use this app.",derfnturf,
45,"Good app, lousy customer service",False,2018-12-10 04:04:01,1,"I recently used Door Dash to order food, and after 1 hr only received 1/2 of my order, meaning the other person I ordered food for had nothing to eat, beyond splitting my portion with her. Trying to be civil I contacted customer support to find a resolution, the service provider told me he would contact the restaurant to see what went wrong, but made no mention on how the matter would be resolved. When he called back I was informed that the restaurant would remake my lost order, but inferred I would have to pick it up as the delivery person was ‚Äúunreachable ‚Äú. I told the service provider that was unacceptable and asked for a full refund, to which I was told I would only be compensated for the missing items, which is not compensation, that‚Äôs more like to prevent fraud for charging someone for items not received. 

I then asked to speak to his manager, to which I was told there was not one on duty. So I insisted that he provide a full refund, to which he eventually agreed. Then upon receiving my notice from door dash regarding my complaint I saw that only a portion of my order had been refunded, meaning the service provider lied over the phone.

I would not trust this delivery service, as it appears to be a Russian roulette if you will receive your full order, and instead of compensating for the mistake they will simply refund you the money of what you didn‚Äôt get, like they are doing you a favor for not charging you for food you didn‚Äôt get.",BigBossSSB,

The last person helped me and by then the restaurant closed :( I went through it again with door dash representative and after another 25 minutes the other restaurant closed! What is super frustrating process that you have two claim your credits. At the very end I was able to order from the only restaurant that I could eat at that was gluten-free that was open. Not what I had planned on doing but just wanted to use my credit so it would be over with. So again super frustrating process and not being able to use the credit to what I wanted to use it for but just had to use it so I would get it over with. The passing around to another representative after another representative was craziness giving the same information to each new representative and passing it along 3 to 4 times every time I got on the phone and waiting anywhere from 14 to I think it was like 35 minutes at the very end was absurd.

47,Endangering my family with every order.,False,2020-12-14 04:00:17,1,"First off I‚Äôd like to state this review is written during the pandemic by someone who cannot afford to catch COVID. 

The drivers for this app are incapable of listening to the simple request of ‚Äúcontactless delivery‚Äù. Every order arrives with the driver knocking on the door after which I wait because I expect them to put the food down and leave. Sometimes they do just this, but the majority of the time they continue to knock again and again with increasing aggression. I have now opened the door far too many times to find the driver standing less than a foot away from the door asking if this is my order. Several times they have even handed me the food directly. It is incomprehensible to me that this has happened so frequently when ‚Äúcontactless delivery‚Äù is currently advertised all over the app. I can‚Äôt see it being anything other than the training for the drivers right now. I know that many people aren‚Äôt worried about the pandemic and would have no problem with this but I have to visit my parents weekly and I do not feel comfortable risking their safety. Our address is clearly stated on the order and it is not hard to find so I know that is not the issue here. I have decided to stop using these delivery apps completely as this problem is widespread across all of them.

Disregard this review after the pandemic has ended as the apps themselves are incredibly useful.",Harmon89,
48,Credits only last for ONE order,False,2020-11-08 23:52:02,1,"My last 3 orders had issues: Cracker Barrel took over 2 hours to make me breakfast with minimal updates sent from the app or from my dasher. I had to text myself to ask what was happening. Then Uno‚Äôs sent a small cup of dip and a few pita chips for what was supposed to be a bread bowl of dip with additional tortillas. However, I figured that I wouldn‚Äôt give up on the app since they were quick to issue a credit for the incorrect or missing items. On my 3rd time, I ordered McDonalds breakfast at work so that I could have coffee while my students took their final exams virtually (Boring!) I received a sandwich only. Not the meal. No coffee. 

Alert, it‚Äôs about to get mathematical!! I used my $11 and change credits to get a $5 breakfast. Which was , again, made incorrectly! So instead of having a remaining credit balance I was stuck with no coffee and no help. And the Door Dash customer service said they issued me a credit of $2+ for the jacked up Mickey Ds, but it didn‚Äôt take. So my next and LAST order for $20 was charged full price. It should have been more like $12 since there was about $8 of credit remaining from all the issues. 

I‚Äôm switching to GrubHub or Uber Eats. The errors were not their fault, but the resolution was their responsibility. Had I GONE to those restaurants in person, I would have received my money back. That‚Äôs what I pay the SERVICE FEE for them to handle for me! On every order.",JewellBookwr,

I had spoken to tech support and followed instructions but it wouldnt let me order still. I deleted the app, cleared everything, restarted my phone, etc. Over and over again. Called in for help multiple times and promised it would be fixed. Each person was useless because the only info they could give me was the same but no one actually tried to help. Also, had 2 people end conversation with me and i had to speak to someone else. Then, promised they would bring it to the higher up and someone would call me or touch bases but no one did. Called back to touch bases and was told dont worry in 2 days we would have a resolution. Which by this point its been a month. Still no help and no response. Its really disappointing when you have spent so much money with a company and you make sure you tip everyone. But when it comes to you getting help or good customer service, they are highly lacking.

I also was a dasher for a short time and when it came time for me to be paid, the company did not pay me, I spent dozens of hours talking to doordash and my bank, both assuring me that the other was the problem.

The customer is NEVER right which is funny because as a driver everything is your fault too everyone‚Äôs fault but the actual restaurant or DoorDash.  It‚Äôs honestly the worst food delivery app and maybe it‚Äôs because it got too popular so they have kids delivering orders and not caring but to be charging for taxes deliver fees driver fees and tips and still not get a drink or half the sides out of a $50 dollar order is absolutely mind boggling.

I reached out to DoorDash and was told that my account had been disable because of activity that ‚Äúviolated their terms and conditions.‚Äù Unfortunately, they will ONLY communicate via email. I scrolled their terms and conditions and saw nothing odd about it. Confused, I responded and requested additional information.

When I attempted to go through the app, they were offering to keep $20 of my money, plus charge me $6 for the item I didn‚Äôt want, and refund me what was left. So basically, I pay them $27 to not receive what I ordered. The only resolution left being chat, at which point I only receive a refund for my purchase after 35 minutes, and still don‚Äôt have what I ordered. This is only the most recent example. Of my last 5 orders, 4 have resulted in needing some type of refund for missing items or missing entire deliveries. This doesn‚Äôt even account for the delays of 30-90 minutes from initial time estimate. I was huge advocate for DoorDash for years, but they have seriously changed for the worse in the past few months.",User:31745296,
65,DoorDash! Crazy or just down right awful?,False,2021-07-02 23:38:16,4,"I‚Äôve tried many other delivery options and have had no noticeable difference in terms of service with the other ones.  When it comes down to it it‚Äôs what people are working for them is what makes them out to be.

So is DoorDash really worth trying out or should you just MoveOn? I think people should give a try the DoorDash. Makes them different from their competitors is there pricing. Now granite any order you make that have someone else doing it for you and bringing it for you is going to cost you a handful of money. Depending on how much I use it though can change how much you‚Äôre spending.  For example whenever I use Uber eats I spend at least $20 or more depending on how big the meal is. Whenever I use DoorDash though, it is roughly always under. Again it may be only a couple dollar difference but if you order food that much it starts to really add up. 

My conclusion is is that if you‚Äôre not satisfied with your current service that you‚Äôre using or wanna different one you should definitely try DoorDash next. Don‚Äôt take my response for granted though everybody can have a different experience and if you think I‚Äôm wrong that‚Äôs fine go ahead and try something elseüëç",Gyouedbuihubhxuhih,

I expressed my concern about this as it was already getting late and I wasn‚Äôt sure when the establishment closed. He reassured me and told me my food would certainly be delivered. I was fine with the redelivery so long as I would receive my food; in that case I had no need to care about a refund nor did I request a credit for the inconvenience. I just wanted my food. I got the confirmation email for the redelivery... then got another email several minutes later stating that my new order had been cancelled. I contacted Doordash again and now they couldn‚Äôt refund back to my card because it was changed to a ‚Äúredelivery.‚Äù The only thing they could give me was a credit to my Doordash account.

Just discovered that I paid a lot more on the items through the app than what the actual cost at the restaurant is. Plus, there is ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù (as if artificially increasing the item prices wasn‚Äôt enough), Plus there‚Äôs a delivery fee AND a tip that you pay ahead of time regardless if the driver did a good job or not. I can probably live with the high delivery fees and the tip, because at least some of it actually goes to the driver, but inflating the restaurant prices and charging a service fee on top of that is just too much.

Finally, they are also being dishonest about delivery times. Before ordering, all places show about 20-40min estimated delivery time, but once you place the order, within a few minutes the estimated times jump up and just get stuck. It says the driver is waiting to pick up my order, but in reality the driver is picking up multiple orders and as new orders come in they just wait for them to be ready as well. The driver then finally leaves the *fast food* restaurant after about 30 minutes or more, and begins their delivery route, which is based on whoever lives closest and not on a first come first served basis. By the time I got my food it was already cold (waited for 70 minutes for a fast food order from a place 6 miles away, most of that time was delivery, not preparation).

However, I was completely disappointed the second one time I used them. I ordered from Wendy‚Äôs. I got a Dave‚Äôs double meal with fries and a coke. I also ordered a medium chocolate frosty. I was periodically checking the app to see how long untill the driver arrived, and when I saw he was 1 minute away, I went outside to meet and greet him. But for some reason, he showed up in his hands, with old a soda(a dr. Pepper I found out, instead of the coke that I ordered) and a frostee. Now, it doesn‚Äôt take a brain scientist to figure out if one leaves the restaurant with only a soda and a frostee, that maybe your missing a few things, just maybe. Who in their right mind would use door dash just to order only a soda and frostee.  But no, this idiot is a few peanuts away from wearing a helmet. And then, I called customer support and sat on hold for 30 minutes! And while I was doing this, I went to help and started chatting with a ‚Äúsupport specialist ‚Äú and of course got me nowhere. The first chat ended after the person said they would try to contact the driver. But after that, I said 10 things in chat and got no response. So I had to close everything out and started a new chat.

The background check on Ubereats is extensive and I think doordash should invest in that for their dashers. Food is too often stolen, brought to the wrong address without compensation, and when this happens customers have to go through multiple bots in order to speak with an associate. On top of this, doordash charges customers an outrageous amount above normal store prices, but then the doordashers are compensated unfairly. During covid I believe you could make a living wage with doordash, I now find that completely untrue. When ordering the recommended tip is usually $5-10, but the dasher views the dash as a total of $2-6, and sometimes aren‚Äôt even fully compensated for the price shown before accepting it. Para the app is a great way to get around this unfairness and greed shown by doordash, but it has been proven over and over that they have no interest sharing a platform with Para. I think the overall basic layout and idea of Doordash is great, I even think it‚Äôs better than most food delivery apps, but when things go wrong or people are unhappy with the app(s), nothing is done or it is shown only the bare minimum can be done.

So I caved, and ordered using DoorDash! So far the only disappointment is the price. A meal for one person averages around $20 with tip depending on the restaurant you order from. But so far I‚Äôve had no bad experiences!! The drivers have been very friendly, and they read your notes. I hope they get payed well, and get their full tips! Also I truly hope they figure out a way to coincide with the businesses true operating hours and days, other then that. It‚Äôs great!! 

I was so excited to finally have Door Dash available in my area! But the business hours for the restaurants aren‚Äôt accurate, and certain restaurants are only available on specific days?? What‚Äôs the point of this app if I cant order from the places I want too? Also, you cant customize your order!! Being familiar with some of the menus, I know the options have been limited and prices have been altered, so you‚Äôre paying more for the so called convenience, along with that extra booking fee or whatever it‚Äôs called, plus tip. But with technology these days, you should be able to provide a fully customizable menu like the actual restaurants app. They do have way more options then Uber Eats does in my area, but what‚Äôs the point when more than half the places aren‚Äôt available?

After about an hour of the app saying the driver was at the restaurant, I tried contacting him and the number didn‚Äôt work. The app kept extending the amount of time it was taking to get to my house. Mind you, the restaurant was only about 10 minutes from our house. Finally I tried calling the restaurant but it was closed at this point. So I used the app to contact customer support. They said they would cancel the order and refund the cost. They blamed the driver for being unprofessional. After a few minutes my credit card was charged a second time for the same amount instead of getting a refund. I was unable to contact customer support on the app anymore because there was no order history. So I had to search a phone number to contact them to resolve my credit card issue. They said the only resolution was to send them a screen shot of my credit card statement before I could be refunded the double charge.

I recommend you fire him so the company doesn‚Äôt look bad. I can‚Äôt even see his name to report him. Should update the app to show names even after the delivery. I never ordered from here before and the ratings looked promising. Now that this happened, I will never order from here, and will make sure my friends/family don‚Äôt either. Honestly the worst ordering experience ever. He said he had trouble locating me and left the food at the front door. Nothing was there. And there wasn‚Äôt a possibility of it being stolen because as soon as I got that notification I instantly went outside. And my dog also barks when there are people at the door and he never barked. Which leads me to believe that he never was close to my house. I realized how easy it was to just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm arriving‚Äù and never do so.

Then when she got in her car I was spammed with notifications in the order that they should have come (Your dasher has picked up your order and is on the way, your dasher is approaching, and your food has been delivered.). The next problem I had is with scheduling. For all of my orders I made, I was at work, busy. I had scheduled the orders for 5p and the dasher  came an hour early. The Taco Bell immediately started to make my order and I got my food within 10 minutes of me placing the order. Which was at 3:50p or so. The food came perfect. I had what I ordered exactly.

Our restaurant has absolutely no affiliation with Door Dash yet we are constantly plagued by calls from Door dash trying to place orders for pickup.

So after being harassed over the phone by door dash drivers begging us to make an exception ‚Äúthis one time,‚Äù they still show up to pick up orders that don‚Äôt exist for items that we don‚Äôt have and are irritated at us that they have to contact their customers to fix the issue. And just now we had a courier come in and aggressively sexually harass the young girl I was working with with unsettling pick up lines. With Caviar and postmates we, the restaurant, know the name of the courier and are able to report them for any inappropriate behavior or rudeness. Since door dash operates under the table and without the restaurant‚Äôs consent, we have no idea who this guy was and wouldn‚Äôt even know how to specify who he was for a report. I would sure like to know a delivery app that was sending people to my house wasn‚Äôt sending creepy men who hit on young girls.   We have told DoorDash multiple times to take us off their app and we still have couriers showing up.

After waiting over an hour for my food I had to cancel the order and re-order the food. 

Another time, the Dasher picked up my order and it was on the way, then the order was marked as delivered. When I checked my porch, the order was nowhere to be found. The Dasher didn‚Äôt take the picture to confirm it was dropped off. I called the Dasher, he stated the order was left at my door and that he rang the doorbell. He confirmed my address and even described my house accurately. My doorbell never rang and I even have cameras in front of my house so I know that he didn‚Äôt deliver it. It seems like he drove by and just kept the food. But he kept arguing with me and lying that he dropped it off. Again, I had to re-order my food.

The bad: some bad dashers who don‚Äôt put effort into making sure they‚Äôre at the right location, or that they got everything you needed.

However, I almost always meet the dasher, I.e., the delivery person, in front of my house and accept the order in person, hand to hand.  The automated notification that per my instructions the order was left at my doorstep is simply fabricated by their computer system and bears no resemblance to the truth.  It happens every time without exception and is very aggravating because it is almost always false, and reflects a software design decision on their part to just copy what the customer had indicated regarding delivery instructions and report that those instructions had been fulfilled ‚Äúper the customer‚Äôs request‚Äù with absolutely no regards to what really happened.",Fire Ghost Dancer,

However another hour goes by and I still didn‚Äôt get my order delivered, so I checked the status. To my surprise, no dasher picked up my order and it was pending. Mind you, by this time I had already waited one hour and a half. I could have just went to Burger King myself and picked up my food and finished it by then, but I was being lazy to drive at 10pm. So I decided to cancel my order, otherwise I who knew when I would have received my order and if it would have even been warm. I know this wasn‚Äôt Burger kings fault, unless they didn‚Äôt notify a dasher, but at least I expected a full refund and not just delivery and tip considering it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I email the doordash customer support, and instead of refunding me the money they basically blamed me for cancelling the order. This is their business, in which they need to make sure there are sufficient dashers delivering peoples food to avoid cancellations. What a rip off to the the consumer.

I told the driver that I had received my order earlier but it was missing an item, so I requested a replacement delivery.  Over an hour later, the app displayed 'delivered' for the replacement order but nothing ever came.  When I reached out to support, I was first told the order had been delivered, then asked if anyone else could possibly have picked up the order.  When I said no multiple times, he finally offered to call the driver and 'see what happened.'  He then claimed that I told the driver that the missing item had already been delivered (I most certainly did not), and asked me that same question again two times for good measure.  I was first offered a 'full refund,' thinking that would be for my entire order, then it was walked back to a credit, then ultimately a credit for only the missing item.  After 2 screw-ups and wasting several hours of my time, the least he could have offered was to (finally) deliver the item, if not a full refund on the entire order, and on top of it he rudely ended the chat when I requested to speak with someone else.

Most recently we tried an order from Safeway (grocery items) - literally like 8 items, all simple grabs from 2 places in the store.  Would have taken me 10-15 minutes if I had done it myself - 2 hours later after watching them weave through the entire neighborhood (I guess he was delivering 5+ orders) we finally got our order, and 1 item was missing.   No explanation - we weren‚Äôt charged but we needed that item and now it‚Äôs too late to get a replacement.  We‚Äôre literally 10 mins from the store - next time I‚Äôll just walk there.  I‚Äôve done instacart with $250 of groceries (full week‚Äôs supply) and it‚Äôs taken HALF the time as what was basically dessert and some fruit (literally that‚Äôs all it was).

The app only gives you the option of reporting missing items NOT fixing the order. So when like tonight we got the entire wrong order (and $15 worth of food for an $85 order) after making us wait for over an hour on the delivery it only gave an option if a credit. So only one if us gets dinner tonight? Too late to put in another order or go to the grocery store and start from scratch. Not being reliable is really unacceptable.",DevonZmaj,

Ordered from a restaurant recently and it arrived with the sticker seal suspiciously askew and not very sticky and my large fry looked half eaten. You could even see the oil stains at the top of the fry carton where the fries had been resting but were no longer there. It was also the first time I neglected to leave a tip (I always opt for the automatic tip) but for some reason the option didn‚Äôt come up and I didn‚Äôt realize it until after I reviewed my receipt. Maybe it was the error of a restaurant employee but given the excellent experiences I‚Äôve had with them, it‚Äôs very unlikely. Sadly there‚Äôs no way to be sure and after some digging it would seem this company is notorious for having poor customer service and skimming tips from drivers. Most drivers are probably decent but sooner or later you‚Äôre bound to get drivers who have no guilt about helping themselves.

In my mind I‚Äôm not paying extra for the convenience, I‚Äôm paying extra for the possibility of having someone digging their fingers into me and my family‚Äôs food.

No, we‚Äôll over an hour and a half later still nothing. So I called the restaurant letting them know I still hadn‚Äôt received my order. Over 2 1/2 hours from the original order.

119,Could be a lot better,False,2020-09-09 20:03:35,3,"I really like DoorDash and use it all the time (definitely more than I should.. üòÖ). For my busy schedule, the pros of having lunch delivered tend to outweigh the cons but I definitely have some frustrations with DoorDash. 

First, there should be a way to change the Dashers tip after delivery. Quite often a restaurant will forget something and the Dasher does not check the order to confirm everything is there. I have had orders delivered with entire meals missing! On the other hand, there are Dashers that go above and beyond to make sure everything is how you ordered it and communicate any problems, delays, etc quickly. I would love to be able to give a better tip to these Dashers! Along with that, it would be really great if the app had a way to save your favorite Dashers and even request them if they‚Äôre available when you place an order. 

Next, the delivery estimates are not great. It usually changes after you place the order. Also, sometimes the Dasher has another order that they‚Äôre dropping off before yours, so the app will tell you they‚Äôre leaving the restaurant and the time til delivery will be like double the time it actually takes to get to your address. By the time they get there you‚Äôre hangry and now you have to eat cold (and sometimes soggy!) food. üòë",dr_claw,

I‚Äôm not always able to tip big amounts but every time I do I feel as if the driver they send just isn‚Äôt reliable not sure what that‚Äôs about. All in all this is the best food delivery app in my opinion, but if the restaurant is further away I recommend just going to get it yourself.

Edit - I gave an additional star for the exceptional customer service, they can‚Äôt always help you, but they do put you into consideration and try to do the best that they can to make up for an inconvenience if any. The only thing I wish would be that the drivers actually got the messages you tried to send and that you got the choice of how much to tip AFTER you‚Äôve received your food, I‚Äôve highly tipped unprofessional drivers because I‚Äôm forced to tip upfront and I give most people the benefit of the doubt.

This system is so broken, I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.

You can‚Äôt expect your food to be WARM when you order from these guys ever but in this case it was ice cold and soggy by the time it got here. My order just now got picked up by someone who wasn‚Äôt even my DoorDash driver just because they CLAIMED to be my DoorDash driver.

I eat quite often in restaurants therefore I know the menu and the price of many of them, in this app the prices are higher than in the restaurant, for example a basic sushi roll that in the restaurant is 5-6 $ in  the app shows that the price is 8-9 $ the same food, and normally they don't give you the food with the receipt or it breaks the receipt so you can't see the original price of the food, so you have to pay fee, taxes,  delivery, tip, and food overprice",natrejo,

I had to ask for a refund. Then I was told it would take 5-7 business days which is a complete joke. No bank takes that long to process a refund... especially when it is the fault of the business and not the consumer. Additionally, I had to negotiate a discount for future use. When asked how I would be compensated for my troubles, I was told they would allow me to use the discount that I used on the food that I never received. So they had to ask a supervisor if it was ok to give me $5 off my next order. I believe that good customer service is apologizing sincerely, offering a rushed refund under special circumstances, and offering the $5 instead of me suggesting that I receive some form of compensation for my boss and his client not having any LUNCH at his LUNCH meeting. Door Dash clearly has dishonest drivers (as my stat said my food had arrived) and incompetent people working there Help chat (Jommel). Do yourself a favor and only use Uber eats.

Also, recently I ordered milk shakes for myself and daughter and when our food and milkshakes arrived our milkshakes had spilled all over the cup carrier and down the side of the cup to the point when I picked the carrier up, it was leaking out of the bottom of it.

I decided to give it a chance, and what a mistake that was. I ordered my food and was charged. However, my order was picked up from the restaurant by the driver but never delivered though it appeared on my account as if it had been delivered. I went through the Help icon in the app and was #88 in line to start a chat with a representative. I then called customer service and waited on hold for 30 minutes before speaking with someone. The representative first challenged me on whether the food had actually not been delivered, then told me that they were unable to get in touch with my driver. They offered me a refund that would go through in 5-7 business days or longer depending on my bank. By this time, about an hour after I originally placed my order, most restaurants were no longer taking orders for delivery. For this inconvenience, Door Dash credited me $5 to my next purchase. I informed them there would not be any further purchases because of their egregiously poor customer service and lack of accountability on their employees who don‚Äôt do their job.

I don‚Äôt ever use UberEats since there‚Äôs no use because nothing can beat DoorDash IMO, I also have DashPass and with it in the long run it will save you a ton of money if you use DoorDash consistently, it‚Äôd even save you money if you just used DoorDash 5-10 times a month even. 

I can‚Äôt think of anything negative to say honestly, my food is always warm, I haven‚Äôt had to warm anything up once. My food is usually sealed too when it arrives so I don‚Äôt have to worry about anyone tampering with my food if their disgruntled if the tip wasn‚Äôt to their liking. The drivers are always friendly also, and their always quick to arrive unless traffic is bad which is understandable in my area.

When I had originally ordered it at 5:30, it was on the ‚Äútry for free‚Äù list. Which is funny, because I think I just missed the window, the first couple of times when I tried to reorder the app kept crashing (I‚Äôm guessing it was from trying to pay via Apple Pay when there was a negative balance (since I had more credits then the total)). So I chatted with another rep to get my $4 back, because I really felt like I was being charged $4 for something that was not my fault to begin with. They said no, so I had the order cancelled (and at this point it was really more out of fairness than being not hungry (because at this point I was pretty sad and hungry)). I ended up ordering from Yelp Eat24 instead, and will now probably go there first for ordering food rather than DoorDash (until/if Yelp takes my money for something that‚Äôs not my fault). Anyway, nothing on the customer reps, they were very helpful. This is more for maybe a line item on DoorDash customer retention, and/or maybe not.

DoorDash has a lot more restaurant choices. Unlike Postmates, DoorDash only gives the tipping options at the time of purchase. If there‚Äôs a way to change it, I would love to learn how it‚Äôs done. How do you know how much of a tip the driver should get or if they deserve one at all. I have had drivers ignore instructions not to go to the door by my garage (where I cannot see or hear them), cold food, food arriving too late... . I‚Äôve had way too many orders with missing items. Why should I commit to tipping up front for this? DoorDash needs to put pressure on drivers to check orders before leaving the restaurant! Maybe start deducting the cost of missed items from the driver‚Äôs guaranteeed fee? I wish they could also deduct for cold food. If the food arrives really cold(or melted for cold stuff) there‚Äôs only a few explanations. The driver arrived at the restaurant too late or accepted too many orders and items got cold during multiple stops. If DoorDash has too many incidents, drop that driver. Maybe let customers request drivers who have good star ratings, or ones that they liked from prior orders-to encourage good service. Lyft and Uber do it, why not food delivery companies?",Tamwee,

I contacted DoorDash right away and they said they won‚Äôt refund me for the missing/wrong items because I supposedly made too much complaints.

I was never informed or saw on the menu that the McFlurry were unavailable to make. I contacted Door Dash and again they said that I cannot be refunded because of previous complaint. So Door Dash are you falsely promoting advertisement of refunding items that are unavailable or never received?

They said doordash called them and oders and were really confused with the oders. So, If Doordash can call the resturant why could not they call me about the order been canceled? Why time and again i was shown the order is being prepared? And at last i called the customer service department, they were not feeling a little bit of guilty about their service. One of the customer service representative put me on hold when i was talking. At last, A manager called me because i asked for the doordash credit for all the hassels.

140,Got an idea...,False,2020-09-15 01:08:25,5,"Maybe add a language translation feature for your dashers. In most places, not all dashers speak perfect English. When texting a dasher better directions, especially apartment complexes, it‚Äôs easy to get lost and food doesn‚Äôt get delivered. You should give an option for a dasher to have a preference on language.
 For instance, my dasher who was very pleasant spoke minimum English. I live in a very large apartment complex and all kinds of delivery crew get lost. When it was time to give better directions, I had to specifically ask his ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù language to speak (which was Portuguese), download and use a translate app just to get him in the right direction. If you guys can add some sort of language translation feature for your driver profiles (maybe make it optional but helpful) into this app, I‚Äôm sure you would have higher percentages of satisfaction for both your clients and employees... I know it‚Äôs 2020 and many people are prejudice, however the truth is most delivery drivers are multi-cultural. I honestly believe this would be very helpful.

I got a call after they disconnected the live chat without warning roughly 20 minutes later. This is unacceptable for an order that was falsely marked as delivered. I talked to customer service and they offered an app credit or full refund in 5-7 days. There was no offer or effort to get my missing food to me at all. They said that I could place an order with a different restaurant or replace the order and they would ‚Äúmake sure‚Äù that my order was delivered. When I asked how they would do this, the customer service representative said they would make sure they had the best dasher on it. There should be no tiers of dashers. When you order food and it is marked as delivered, it should be because you have received your food- which I never did.

Usually with the other apps, it will be a temporary charge on your card until the food is confirmed as delivered by the driver. with doordash? it's holding ALL that money from you for 5-7 business days regardless if you got it or not. (day 6 still waiting by the way.) so let's summarize this...... i tried to order food 4 times one after the other from 4 different restaurants with each order costing around $30, all of them cancelled (weather problems, it was snowing a lot) with $30 taken out my account each time without receiving my food which took over 4 hours in total. 4 hours of waiting, $120 out of my account for a week, and no food at all. that's doordash! customer service also saying there's nothing they can do.

Naturally you reach out to the customer service line because it‚Äôs been about a half hour longer than they quoted.

As a rule I‚Äôm a great tipper, and several times when my order has arrived incorrectly I basically rewarded him or her in advance for sloppy service. If items are missing, you don‚Äôt have the option to speak to the driver or have them redeliver the missing items. Instead the app refunds you, which is good I guess, but then if you still want those items, which of course you do, that‚Äôs why you ordered it, now you have to pay the delivery fee and tip all over again, and wait however much time it takes. If you complain you are given absolutely no response from the app, driver, or restaurant. You‚Äôre just on your own. The refund tells me the app just assumes if the customer has their money back, then they should be satisfied. But really I just want what I ordered and I don‚Äôt want to pay for it twice. 

I just tipped $9 in advance on a $44 order. 1/3 of my order was missing. So now the driver has $9, and will get even more tip plus a $4 delivery fee to the app, if I want to take the risk and order again, with a chance it‚Äôll be screwed up again.

When I submitted a complaint about this to DoorDash, their response was that they wanted to ‚Äúset customer expectations‚Äù and that the driver tried calling about the delivery (BTW: from some number that looked like some other unrelated business) and that it was okay to dump food on my doorstep without ringing the door bell. Well I‚Äôm here to SET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS! As a customer I expect the driver to walk the 10 steps to the door and ring the doorbell while my food is hot, and especially when I Pre-tip, as this has been the tried, tested and proven process of food delivery for decades. 

So DoorDash... you are in a market that is very crowded with your competitors and you are definitely setting yourself apart, for sure, with your extremely bad service and as a company that probably won‚Äôt be around long. This is not the first time I‚Äôve experienced this with your delivery drivers. So now your app is getting deleted and I won‚Äôt be surprised when your company goes under. I‚Äôll be sure to spread the word.",masseraj50,
152,I use this app too much but it needs some improvement,False,2022-08-20 23:28:32,4,"I like using DoorDash over the other apps at the moment. There are a few things they could improve. A major one is having specials available on their app. A second major pet peeve is this app never takes outside coupon codes or store gift cards. All of these are Very annoying! Free delivery & DoorDash discounts are nice but it don‚Äôt make up for the higher prices, added taxes, specials not listed, or taking coupon codes/gift cards that work everywhere else. 

One more thing. I always tip & feel that is warranted for a delivery but a suggested tip of $10 added to an order that is less than 2 miles away is excessive. If you don‚Äôt change the amount it will go through. And the added ‚Äúare you sure you want to leave that tip? It‚Äôs a bit low‚Äù pop up is infuriating. Maybe the marketing strategy works on some people but it‚Äôs rude in my opinion. Trying to shame someone into tipping more than they can or want to is not cool. We are already paying more to use this app & forced into limited menus. You‚Äôre shame marketing is a bit overboard. Seriously, get rid of it! And except coupon codes & gift cards.",SawtoothOnYT,
153,Worst service,False,2022-08-01 17:49:54,1,I don‚Äôt typically write reviews but this experience was super frustrating. I ordered a lunch through jersey mikes app which unknown to me at the time uses DoorDash for its delivery service. I thought it was a JM driver but it‚Äôs DoorDash. Well DoorDash picks up my lunch and never delivers it. Called JM who instructs me to call DoorDash. So I call DoorDash who apologizes and re submits my order to JM again since the driver took my lunch. So JM makes the lunch again and hands it off to the DoorDash driver with clear instructions. DoorDash driver again steals the lunch. :/ Twice DoorDash driver has stolen my lunch. I was able to get a refund from JM. DoorDash did nothing to repair this issue with me other than an apology and a report on the driver. I asked for a credit or something since It was their drivers that stole the orders and I had run out of time on lunch break thus not eating. The problem was clearly from DoorDash and not JM. But since I didn‚Äôt order through the DoorDash app directly they wouldn‚Äôt do anything of the sort. I asked to speak to someone higher up to inquire about this and was told the individual I was speaking with was the supervisor (John B) which I‚Äôm sure was as true as the name he game me. Worst customer service and worst experience. This company clearly doesn‚Äôt care about its customers. Thankfully JM was super helpful and I got my money back. But it was no thanks to DoorDash.,LadyK6689,

You can look things up on Google and they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúGrubhub is one of the few delivery apps that take cash, depending on location wise‚Äù I did a little experiment with that statement, went on every single restaurant in my area, including pizza places.. no sign of the cash option.

Both reperesentives were rude, and didn‚Äôt seem like they cared. I recommended that they put a filter in, so everyone can see what places you can pay cash with instead of looking through every place, like I had to do, doubt they even took it in consideration. In reality grubhub is just like all the other apps. I had high hopes with this one, but my mind is changed.

So live chat with customer service and they have a hard time understanding me. She tells me that she can have the restaurant remake the food and send another dasher out this is 2 hours in at this point. I say only if I get a full refund as well. She has a hard time understanding me again so I ask to speak to a supervisor. I wait another 10 minutes for a phone call to basically hear that he can‚Äôt guarantee a refund if we get the food. So after verbal gymnastics forever we agree that I‚Äôm just going to cancel my order and get a full refund and just not use door dash again. As soon as we come to that agreement he says I‚Äôll get an email confirming everything just then I either get hung up on or my call dropped. Unbeknownst to me this whole time I‚Äôm arguing with him they reassigned my order to another dasher anyway so now it‚Äôs 3 hours after I placed my initial order and I finally got some stone cold food that according to the receipt was made 2 hours ago. Now obviously I get back in touch with customer support chat and ask to talk a supervisor again to sort this all out they said a supervisor will call me and they never did.

I was out of town visiting folks, and after successfully using UberEats twice, I tried DoorDash for delivery because it was the only available option on a Monday in that area. After being told our total was $67 plus tax, we got the cash together to give the driver a tip. After our food was delivered, I received a prompt to give both the doordasher and the restaurant a review. I gave them both full stars.

Lots of advertisement if ‚Äúonly $1 delivery charge for the first month‚Äù... but really, that is only on first order. Also a majority of the restaurants require $15 minimum and a $5.99 delivery charge.                       2) No response to review of orders that we received. We tried it twice.

Another time, the driver arrived almost an hour late.  She was rude and argumentative when I expressed my displeasure with her tardiness.  When I complained to Door Dash about a third delivery where the sauce made with peanuts was spilled in the bag and leaked into the other popped-open containers I received no response.  The food was inedible as one of the dishes was for a person with a severe peanut allergy.  It seems to me that, if we are being charged a service fee on top of a delivery fee, we should be getting some service.

I contacted customer service to request a re-delivery (or refund). The ""customer service"" agent refused my request ""based on my account history""(?)

It seems as though DoorDash takes great offense when one reports delivery issues with their delivery service, and they feel like they can dump on their customer without recourse. I don't recommend using a service that does things like this to their customer.

I've cancelled my DoorDash subscription and will not be returning. I will use another smaller, local service in the future for my food delivery. I've launched a charge dispute. I'll get my money back from my credit card company, it will cost DoorDash to manage, and DoorDash's merchant account will be dinged with a negative rating due to the charge back. Why?

But Door Dash doesn't walk up, order their customers' food/s, pick it up, and deliver; they call in beforehand‚Äîand they don't disclose that they are a Door Dash representative making the phone-order. They used to at least have a set ""script"" that makes it easy for us to ask if it is Door Dash calling, but lately they've been placing orders as if they were regular customers. Once the delivery guy comes in to pick up the order and we tell them that we charge 15%, every single person has thrown a fit, saying that we HAVE to let them know on the phone that there will be such charge, otherwise we can't charge them.

When I exited the patients room I saw that I had notifications and immediately headed downstairs to meet the dasher. He proceeded to yell at me over the phone about what was taking me so long. After that he arrived at the front door of the hospital and continued to verbally insult me while hanging my bag of food out of his window. I advised him I couldn‚Äôt walk to his car because the doors would lock me outside. He then got out of his car and continued to verbally berate and accost me at the front door of my hospital. The entire interaction was himulating and disgusting. Here I am putting myself at risk taking care of these high risk patients only to be belittled and insulted by one of your drivers. Furthermore I asked your driver to meet me at the main entrance so he wouldn‚Äôt be put at risk by entering the hospital. I ordered from postmates the same way a few days prior and the driver was kind enough to figure out what floor I was on and deliver my food in hand. Even though I had requested to pick up my food outside. That‚Äôs what respect looks like. Your driver is a representation of your company and as a result I will never use your service again.,Keesh10343,

They take a whole hour to bring food when you literally live 7-10 minutes away from the restaurant. I work in a restaurant and Door Dash calls to tell us what the order is....their menu isn‚Äôt updated first of all.....they themselves don‚Äôt care to give the right orders, when I ask more questions on how customers want certain things (example: sushi) they just take a guess depending on the price. They messed up a lot of my customers‚Äô orders and these customers take it out on us. Some understand, some don‚Äôt. The drivers are rude, impatient and feel entitled to get mad when sometimes, door dash calls for the orders late. Sometimes the representative calls, and the driver shows up literally a minute later when I said the wait was 20-30 minutes. Poor service, poor communication.... I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre still lasting and I‚Äôm usually understanding because I‚Äôve been working in a restaurant for 6 years and I feel bad ordering without tipping but my tips aren‚Äôt worth the hour wait when my city is small.

At time of order, could you maybe show the number of available Doordashers and how far they are? That would make a Huge difference! I get all anxious wondering how long it‚Äôs going to take for a dasher to accept the order! And the other thing is... if they have multiple stops.... give us the option to accept that driver or not!! I‚Äôve waited 2 hours before because my dasher had multiple stops and Then the driver was unprofessional!!! When I‚Äôm hungry, I‚Äôm not trying to wait 2 hours for my food!!

They literally block drivers numbers so when you try calling it‚Äôs seems inactive (try it!) and even calling from a different number works but pressing 3 (for dasher) it hangs up on you. I honestly can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs true but I experience it myself. and when trying to file a support ticket they give you a million and one FAQs without giving you the option to file a ticket unless you guess and finally open the right FAQs which are usually for merchants or customers. You can‚Äôt talk to support at all unless you‚Äôre actively on an order and then have to wait 30 minutes in a line to talk to an agent. They messed up my pay now I have to wait a whole other week, and that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. My only tip is that you tip your dashers in cash because 1. You‚Äôll get a more passionate dasher who isn‚Äôt so greedy seeing the low guaranteed earning. And 2.greedy Doordash will supplement the guaranteed earning with a part of your tip to give us the minimum payout for the order and pocket the remainder (unless you tip after the orders placed.)

I enjoy the convenience though the more you use it the more you realize it isn‚Äôt that great. When an issue occurs you can tell support is reading from a script. They can only do so much to try and assist. Most of the time it‚Äôs credits or a refund if it‚Äôs one of the severe cases. Sometimes it‚Äôs nothing cause if it happens too much it becomes your fault. Times like those they pretty much tell you that too but in a scripted sincere way as to appear human. If you‚Äôre looking for a snack here and there it‚Äôs a good waste of money.

Now you can dispute it which doordash will refund you in about 7 days but only for one of the things that went wrong, if there was something wrong with more than one item you'll have to contact customer support whom is based on another country & will become upset at the fact that you complain because you not getting what you ordered on the app is nothing compared to the world's problems because their country is impoverished & they can't stand that you would ever complain about your order going wrong & refuse to help you along with trying to guilt trip you for ever being you. All I want is a simple ""Chinese"" ,""pizza"" delivery to my door as always but somehow it becomes an ordeal where I'm told if my order is incomplete & dispite the fact I paid double the price that I should not complain if someone stole my food or if an item is missing because the world is a terrible place.

Your $5 sandwich can quickly turn into a $20 order. Personally found it‚Äôs also much faster if you order and pick up your food yourself. A coffee order will take me 5-10 minutes to pick up from my nearby coffee shop from the time of ordering it, while getting a dasher to pick it up means it will be at your place in 40min. One thing I do like is that Door dash at least offers you the option to order from all its listed restaurants and let you pick up your food yourself, which is very convenient for local restaurants that don‚Äôt have an app or website to order through themselves. Now I don‚Äôt order a delivery unless I absolutely have to because it‚Äôs too much of a hassle.

Once again I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who advised my order was picked up with all items ordered. I called DoorDash to verify and was advised to wait 10 mins and if no one shows then a credit would been given. No one ever came.

189,Outrageous Prices and Frequently Missing Items,False,2022-01-29 22:31:59,2,"Door Dash was once a revolutionary service, providing delivery from all kinds of restaurants you couldn't get delivery from, generally for the same price as the real menus...fast forward a few years and almost every menu item is marked up 20-40% above what the restaurant charges, and it keeps getting worse. For example, last week I almost ordered Panera through here. The cost seemed high so I checked what Panera was charging on their own website...lo and behold, a $20 pickup order through Panera's website was $30 on Door Dash, BEFORE tax, fees, and tip. Outrageous!

Next problem: Items are frequently missing from orders and when you go through the automated system to report it, you *might* get the cost of the item back (when the feature isn't glitching like it does all the time), but not a prorated refund on the fees and tip. Items are missing so often I'm honestly starting to think something else is going on. Are Dashers taking food? Are they too busy to verify orders? Is Door Dash running a scam to collect extra fees by sometimes not even submitting certain items you order to restaurants? None of it is acceptable, and who knows!

I‚Äôm also a little frustrated about the rating and tipping system for drivers. Like, I‚Äôve been a delivery driver and it annoys me that I have to tip before they deliver my food. When I drove, if my service was top notch, customers would tip me more than they usually would have another driver who did the minimum. I‚Äôve had great DoorDashers and I‚Äôve had bad DoorDashers.

When I called the dasher he said ‚Äúoh yea I don‚Äôt know what you should do‚Äù I asked if he could just pick up the items and deliver them since I assumed they just accidentally got forgotten and he said he could. Then the restaurant called me and relayed the information to me about the item not being available and told me to contact door dash to get a refund since it was their bad that they even had the item listed as an option. My dasher texted me to contact the restaurant to ‚Äúget it figured out‚Äù. My dasher then hounded me and texted me 6 TIMES asking why I didn‚Äôt give him a 5 star review and in his last text said ‚ÄúI really honestly hope I‚Äôm not reading wrong that you didn‚Äôt give me a 5 star review as I definitely don‚Äôt deserve that üôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅ‚Äù.

My brother brought the bag and it was the wrong order. I politely told the driver this wasn‚Äôt correct and if he has our order and he said no. And I asked okay well can you send a message to doordash that I have the wrong order and what we can do from there. He said no I don‚Äôt have that kind of time. So I went ahead and contacted doordash and told them what happened and they refused to give me a refund. Almost $60 worth of food and delivery charges and a tip! I called them to try to see if we could clarify the situation and the person I talked to said no we aren‚Äôt going to refund it. The driver STILL got the tip even though they didn‚Äôt deliver the order and were very rude. I lost $60 to them and no matter who I‚Äôve talked to they REFUSE to refund me.

It's constantly changing and showing me the driver is no where near the restaurant, the arrival time is not consistent and is changing up until the last couple of minutes if arrival. Also, the driver will often deliver to multiple places before to me and that doesn't give an updated time frame, it just says ""arriving now"" but they're 15 minutes away. I'm in patient care so this is a big deal for me. I've also had issue with the driver being a different person than it states on the app. And the vehicle is often dirty, person is unmasked, drinks are delivered questionable in most cases (meaning they're unprotected from tampering with). It's just turned gross and hugely disappointing for what has been and could be a huge device for many people.

That is, RIDICULOUS. Do ya'll know how much money you can waste by one little mess up and how little they will do for you?

Come to find out my last delivery that was supposed to bring my food had delivered it to the management building of my complex instead of my actual house she responded back an hour later The same time my new food arrived saying that my food was at the front door and it was cold so I ended up having two orders of the same food. Overall terrible experience I will never order from DoorDash again and you shouldn‚Äôt either don‚Äôt waste your time.,sillykc,
219,App is too slow and they refuse to give refunds,False,2019-09-08 10:20:21,1,"I had placed an order through the app but canceled as soon as the order finished processing (as they don‚Äôt let you cancel while it‚Äôs processing), the order was canceled under a minute after ordering. DoorDash no longer shows the order within my history but claims that they are unable to give a refund because the kitchen had already received the order and a dashed chosen, things that of course the app never showed. So basically this app doesn‚Äôt update you as it‚Äôs supposed to and then they use that to make sure you can‚Äôt get a refund. And even if an order is successfully placed, mind you, the dashers never follow any instructions written for them and will somehow always get the delivery wrong. Every single time I have placed an order the dashers will call me to meet them in the parking lot instead of at the door because the instructions to go up to the door and ring the doorbell was somehow too complicated and they got confused. Combine this with their terrible customer service and you might as well just use a different app. Uber Eats is just as overpriced and offers the same exact restaurants in my area but instead they actually give rightful refunds and their delivers are able to follow simple instructions. So no, I would never recommend this app, instead just use Uber Eats or any other delivery app",ABellB,
220,My bad experience I had,False,2021-06-15 03:45:50,5,I have used door dash for a while now and I paid a lot of money for stuff I didn‚Äôt even get. For example I ordered tons of shakes from baskin robins and it said my order canceled because there shake machine broke. So I was fine with that until they still made me pay for the door dash and didn‚Äôt give me a refund. Another thing happened when I ordered a couple ice creams for me and my friends for McDonald‚Äôs and then it said my order canceled cause there machine broke too and they still made me pay for it. How is that fair when I didn‚Äôt even get too eat it. Also another time I orders some food and shakes from a place and it was a complete wrong order so I called the man who gave me my order and told him that It was wrong and he answered and told me he doesn‚Äôt speak English so he didn‚Äôt understand what I was saying. Also one time I ordered fries from a place and a car pulled up to my house I went to get the fries and the car door opened and the girl In it was smoking something and blowed it all in my fries and when I got my fries it smelled like weed and smoke.,lylaisinthehouse,

I can admit it‚Äôs kind of tricky finding the entrance of my Apts. But after he called I guided him to my house. Mind you it‚Äôs wet out and I had my newborn in my arms and no shoes in because he continuously passed the only entrance to where I live. Even after he seen me he refused to enter the gate of the complex. I waved and we where still on the phone. He came and as I walked back to my door he backed into a parking spot. I grabbed my Sandals at the door and when I came out again he was leaving! I called him back and he said, ‚Äú IDC you or the apartment ‚Äú! I‚Äôm heated at this point when u just looked me in my face and said u seen me, we saw one another!!! I asked him to pull over where he was and I would come to him. I got in my car and he was a few feet away headed toward the exit of the complex. I stopped and he took off! I followed him for about 8 mins in the Temple Terrace area before I got agitated and went back home to report it to grub hub. I was told he was terminated and my money would be refunded!!!

Unfortunately the company can (and did) choose to not apply their promotion at any time during the stated period, even if you order and re-order the same items from the same exact restaurant while meeting order minimums.

I didn‚Äôt realize it initially, but I‚Äôd been charged for my 2nd and 4th otherwise identical orders‚Äô deliveries from the same place within the 30 day promo period. I did get free delivery for orders 1 & 3. After following up with customer support on the matter and including screenshots of my orders that fell within the promo‚Äôs active window, I was provided this information found in the promos further details (fine print), notified that the fee goes to paying drivers, and directed to the company FAQ page for further information. I then expressed my disappointment via my 3rd email with customer support, including a screenshot of the still active promo on the front page of the app, which finally prompted a refund in the approximate amount of the un-credited orders I‚Äôd initially reached out about.

223,Tips!!!!!,False,2021-11-06 20:58:56,1,"So my biggest problem is the tips. I understand that that how a drive might choose to pick up an order, but i think as the customer we should have the ability at the end of the order to either pay more or reduce to some sort of minimum. Cause I have had dashers ignore instructions and more times then not pick up someone else order, or pick up only have the order before running out the door. Im getting sick of it. And would never tip the amount that they get based on the bad service. On the flip side to that there have been some few who have done really well or gone above and beyond and would love to give them a better til. But since all the bad dashers I have received I'm hesitant to pay a higher tip at the beginning. I suggest that each pick up order be some sorta base amount and that we can in put a temporary higher tip to entice them to maybe do better. And if they do. We have the ability to increase or lower depending on the service. They still get there base regardless, but have the chance to get more if they do well. And it could be set on a timer so if the customer doesn't confirm there tip or change and adjust it it will be submitted after so much time of the order being delivered.

However, the app doesn‚Äôt show my entire address to drivers and it doesn‚Äôt allow for the notes section to show up. Unfortunately my condo address is the same as the hotel next door (different zip codes- same building number). Every time I have ordered to my condo complex- the driver uses the GPS (in lieu of reading notes I could list about my address) and then by the time the food arrives it‚Äôs cold. If there was a section that gave more detail (i.e. building name, complex name, etc) it would be more user and driver friendly. 

Secondly - when ordering food- the app doesn‚Äôt allow for any modifications to the food. It would be nice if I could adjust something (side, lightly seasoned or whatever) when ordering. I am already paying higher for menu item - so it would be nice to have my food how I would prefer.

I kept waiting. Around 8:45 I checked my email and saw that at 8:06 Door Dash sent me a message saying my order was cancelled. After waiting over 2 hours for my order just to find out it was cancelled, I was a little upset. The app does not have anything to connect you with customer service, so I went online and clicked on the chat. I told the customer service rep very politely that I was upset because they basically lied to me in the email. She said let me check and came back to tell me the ‚Äústore ‚Äú was closed. While I was waiting for her to check I called the restaurant which was open until 1am. Regardless, even if they were closed at the point when I was chatting with customer service(which they weren‚Äôt) they were not closed at 8:05 when my Dasher called and said it was going to be a little bit.

There has only been once or twice that I have ordered from the app and not had a problem with my food or my order. I ordered from one place and the entirety of my order was messed up, I ordered from another and only got half of the food I ordered (and paid for) and I ended up having to drive to the food store myself to get the rest of my food anyways. I ordered again and my entire order was poorly made and it was completely the wrong order AGAIN. When my roommate ordered her food was dropped off at the wrong door and when she did find her food it was ransacked, tipped over and food was thrown everywhere (Which isn‚Äôt really doordash‚Äôs fault BUT she was also not offered a full refund and was on the phone with support for 45 minutes to attempt to get her money back). Each time I was not offered a full refund unless it was in door dash credit which is why I‚Äôve continued to order from them so my money doesn‚Äôt go to waste. But it‚Äôs getting ridiculous.

They have a limited selection compared to Postmates and Uber Eats and some simple fast food isn‚Äôt even covered under their ‚ÄúDash Pass‚Äù, like Taco Bell. 

The real issue is that they apparently alter restaurants menus without their knowledge or approval. I ordered stuffed blueberry French toast from a place and got French toast with blueberries and strawberries. The first time This happened I thought, well maybe the place was busy and it was just an oversight. But I ordered it again along with something else about a month later and the same thing happened, and they other sand which did not appear to be as advertised either. When I called the store to figure out what was going on, the employee mentioned that The app ‚Äúfluffs‚Äù up their menu and they don‚Äôt share half the things that are on the app. The establishment has a responsibility to correct this with the app, but still.

This just takes someone going the extra mile. Take a look at my order history and you will see my family and I spend a lot of money on this service but I am close to being done and no longer going to use this service if it does not get better. Reason we have been using it so much is because both my husband and I are combat military Veterans who are beat up. We both still have to work after retiring from the military and by the time we get home, food is an after thought. However the last year I have been 100% disabled from the VA due to hip surgeries connected to the military so ordering food via DoorDash is helpful but many times disappointing. I routinely give a 15% or more tip before the deceiver even gets here. I suppose I can stop tipping until I see what is delivered.  Hot or cold food isn‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs missing condiments that go with specific meals or missing items that come with combo meals.",babz76,
229,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,False,2022-09-30 21:52:05,2,"Some time after coming out DoorDash added the feature for dashers to ‚Äúcomplete other orders nearby‚Äù. Then after creating this problem where the customers food gets cold, DoorDash ‚Äúsolved the problem‚Äù by allowing the customer to pay extra for direct delivery. It‚Äôs ridiculous to ask the customer to pay extra to solve the problem you created. Numerous times I‚Äôve gotten cold food regardless of how good the driver is. Sometimes the nearby customer won‚Äôt come to their door, or the ‚Äúnearby order‚Äù isn‚Äôt nearby at all. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I enjoy hot food, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, I can wait a little longer for my food, but it gets cold. Without this feature I would give DoorDash five stars as a customer, until then it‚Äôs two. I assume the multiple orders feature was only added to appease the dashers who weren‚Äôt being payed properly. But maybe instead of putting that onto the customer you just pay your dashers fairly.

Side note, I would also love if they could add a feature to see the car your dasher is driving, a color and make or something. I live in a city where the dashers have a hard time finding me, and I‚Äôd love to be able to pick out their car and wave them over.",SaveIV,

Well this time they made it SOOO difficult for us. They made us go through a customer service agent and they seriously told us we had to take pictures of missing items?!! Really?? How is that even possible?? We even provided the receipt and everything.. Which they, doordash customer service should have access to already. They just kept telling us they could not help us at all. The dasher also did not take a picture of the order after it was dropped off which 99.9% of the time is what they do. Seriously do not know what on earth is going on with doordash. They said there would be an ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù. But that we cannot get our refund even though there are missing items which like i said several times here, usually is simply handled by just selecting what items are missing and then you just get your refund and then it goes to doordash credit.

The other problem seems to be that drivers can‚Äôt be found sometimes? I don‚Äôt know. Customer service said that can happen, but there are no notifications or warnings about a (pretty big) delay like that anywhere during the ordering process. It just feels a bit shady. Like we ordered food tonight and it said ‚Äúpreparing the order‚Äù 50 minutes into the 45 minute delivery estimate. This was like the 5th time of something weird happening so I called the restaurant.  The food had been ready. I looked at the app and it didn‚Äôt have a driver assigned. So.  Long story short:

Service started off accurate and reliable.  Ended really inconsistent and kind of sketch. 
One thing I will say is that their customer service people are very nice. Honestly, there are better options out there.  If they keep up the way they‚Äôve been going, it‚Äôs not worth the money to feel swindled and/or frustrated.",was great. now terrible,

After an hour and a half, we tried to contact the driver to confirm that our order was still on the way but we couldn‚Äôt get ahold of them, so we contacted customer service. They explained that they frequently ‚Äúbatch‚Äù orders together with other food orders that are in the same area and that our food should arrive in 20 minutes. It didn‚Äôt. We called the restaurant that prepared our food and learned that the food was picked up more than an hour prior. That means our food was sitting out for at least an hour and was unsafe to eat. We had to cancel our order after 2 hours of waiting. We were really disappointed by this experience. While we understand that it makes sense to group deliveries in the same area together, it is completely unacceptable to wait 2 hours for food that should take no more than 30 minutes.

Instead of contacting me, through either SMS or DoorDash, my Dasher claimed to have left my food somewhere stranded in the mall and left.

The third order was more disastrous, with the delivery time again getting later and later, never showing up, and the driver stating they had delivered the order. This involved a vacation location with several hungry children and the parents and grandparents. Needles to say, nerves were frayed and raw, and the evening never really recovered.

The third rep I explained I needed an accurate receipt for the new total for company expense reasons, she went on to explain where to find the receipt and how to print it. The receipt on the account still has the delivery charge.

I was also told the Company charges the proper sales tax for each area to which I explained that was not truthful or they would not be charging sales tax at all!  I ordered a 3rd time & there was the tax again!  I haven‚Äôt called this time to get a refund!  I just don‚Äôt want to fight it each time so haven‚Äôt ordered again!  This is like every other order placed on the Internet or thru an app!  It‚Äôs set up so that the sales tax drops off before the order is finalized!

However, I always watch the map that is displayed just to watch where my delivery is at. Once my food was picked up I watched as the driver headed in what I thought was going to be the direction of my house. But instead of heading to my house he drove to another restaurant where he proceeded to sit there for 30 minute or more. I originally spoke to a customer service rep with DoorDash who said they would credit me 5 dollars for being an hour and a half late. Best part of this is my food still hadn‚Äôt arrived. Once our food finally arrived you could feel from the outside of the containers that it was completely cold. We opened the boxes just to make sure and we confirmed that our food was ice cold. We ordered burgers and fries, so food that really shouldn‚Äôt be ice cold. Needless to say we will never be using DoorDash again as this is absolutely unacceptable for a company that‚Äôs only job is to deliver food and I would causation anyone to look past their lower delivery fee and use a different company that might charge a little more but will provide you better service.  Don‚Äôt risk being out the price of your food (my order was $45) and the wait of almost 2 hours.  Hope this review helps someone avoid this company.",LMCrane,

The support chat was absolutely no help in both situations because they kept repeating that the drivers were at the restaurant probably waiting for the food, and completely ignored the fact that I contacted them because I had been waiting OVER AND HOUR for my food.

I work downtown and it is a 22 mile round trip journey.  After arriving downtown he stopped, made another delivery, then got back on the freeway.  Then GET THIS- he drove around the restaurant again- further out of the way- to reset the trip and then finally drove to my house.

Because this particular menu published stated that Hot and Sour soup was vegetarian, I ordered it, fully knowing that Hot and Sour soup is rarely vegetarian.  I also ordered an array of other non-vegan/vegetarian dishes.  The driver went to the restaurant and noticed that the soup was listed as vegetarian in the app, but was not listed as such on the actual restaurant menu.  Instead of calling or texting me to ask if I was aware of this, the driver opted to order me PLAIN BROTH and did not notify me of that until he pulled up to my house.  The driver had my number because he texted me when he left the restaurant to let me know he was on his way.  The driver then told me that he was confident that the restaurant would refund my money if I called them.  However, it was not the restaurants fault, this was purely HIS FAULT.

Most recently I attempted to order from a local restaurant less than a mile away from me. After waiting for around 40 minutes the app informed me that the Dasher had transferred my order to another Dasher. It was getting late at this point and the restaurant was about to close in around 20 minutes. I continued to wait on the second Dasher. I was then informed that my order had been cancelled after waiting for over an hour because the restaurant was now closed.

I was refunded my money but offered no compensation or recompense for my lost time and the fact that now all the restaurants around me were closed. I contacted customer service and they basically told me this was a non-issue and that I shouldn‚Äôt be upset because I was getting a refund. I‚Äôve had my order cancelled on Grubhub and I was automatically refunded and credited a $10 coupon for my trouble and lost time.

You can watch his progress via GPS on a map displaying the restaurant, your location, and major streets. Some reviewers have expressed shock and dismay that they charge for this service on top of any tip you specify; no doubt the same people who expect all apps to be free. (Side note: the DoorDash app IS free.) After the DoorDash Pass discounts applied to each delivery, the service fee amounts to a few dollars.

I‚Äôd recommend better communication- text or push notifications to warn customers about potential problems as people often can‚Äôt get to the phone.

To describe my frustration, I will start with I am not the only one with the same frustration. Three other coworkers have the same problem. 1.) Credit card selection is abysmal- you have to scroll up on the very last page to change cards. Numerous times me and my coworkers have selected the wrong card. It is far to easy to make a mistake. 2.) Receipts do not show the credit card used. What the HECK?!?! What kind of receipt doesn‚Äôt show payment style? 3.) Address of delivery and what you ordered are on two separate receipts... huge pain in the behind when expense reporting. You have to upload two receipts. 4.) I voiced this concern when on the phone with Door Dash Customer Service over another issue and she had no help to offer and hurried me off the phone bordering on hung up on me. Fix it. Copy the Uber app... it is designed to manage business accounts, expense reporting, and I rarely make a mistake. They even forward my receipts to my expense report app... they‚Äôre the future. I give glowing reviews when I‚Äôm impressed and I have reached the limit of frustration with the Door Dash App... it says a lot when an App‚Äôs design could get someone fired.",nwirt,
266,New support system is bad.,False,2021-02-20 03:36:16,4,"Door dash is often an incredibly convenient way to get a variety of food while minimizing exposure to possible covid infection. While fairly reliable, orders are bound to be wrong on occasion, missing items, or handled poorly by the driver. Previously, you would simply report what was wrong/missing and you‚Äôd be credited, in my opinion, a fair amount. 

However, Now DoorDash forces you to use a live chat support method which often requires waiting approximately 10 minutes. Not only must you wait, while trying to consume the good parts of your order before they go cold/bad, the app and chat must remain open the whole time... you must be actively making sure your phone doesn‚Äôt go to a locked, staring a blank chat window, and hope you don‚Äôt habitually close the app if you need to set your phone down. This will reset your wait time.

While I can‚Äôt say for certain, I‚Äôd bet this change is in response to others abusing the old support system to get credit. This new system can be incredibly tedious and frustrating. Especially since bad orders seem to come in small waves.",aSickHuman,

I was so excited when my little rural town got door dash, because I could finally get food delivered to my jobs. However each time my coworker and I have ordered food, our order has been completely messed up! For instance last night we ordered Wendy‚Äôs, took the driver over an hour and a half to get our good to us, (Wendy‚Äôs is less than 5 miles from our job,) but that‚Äôs not even the ‚Äúbest‚Äù part, when the driver finally arrived he brought us McDonald‚Äôs! Today we tried it again with high hopes, and ordered subway, the first mistake was on the app they had that extra meat was $45‚Äì$50 dollars, so we couldn‚Äôt choose that option. The driver was better then the last one,  and it took her no time to get our food to us, however we ordered two bags of chips and she forgot them. She was nice, and went back to get them, even though we told her she didn‚Äôt have to, but when she came back, she only had one bag of chips!

Trying again, we ordered barbecue. Almost immediately after the order was picked up, we got a notification that the driver had arrived and couldn't find us. The in-app GPS map showed the driver moving down the main road at speed, not far from the restaurant. A few minutes later, I get a message saying the driver left the food at our doorstep. The map never showed him entering the neighborhood, and none of the myriad motion sensors and cameras in front of my house saw anyone come down our street. DoorDash is quick to issue refunds, but never takes any action against sloppy and dishonest restaurants or drivers. DoorDash doesn't even have a reachable customer service department; they're more than happy to call you when they want more money because their menu was wrong, but you can't call them when there's an issue.

To be honest Uber eats would be much better than DoorDash don‚Äôt use this.

DoorDash offered me a credit for the missing item. So tonight I decided to try again from a different restaurant. I ordered an entree salad kids chicken tender meal and 2 pizzas. The driver dropped off one bag at my front door. No pizza. As she was driving down my driveway I yelled to her asking where my pizzas were. She said the restaurant didn‚Äôt give them to her. I called the restaurant and they were sure they gave the driver the 2 pizzas with the other food. We looked on our ring doorbell and ring spotlight and can see the pizza boxes on her passenger seat while she was at our door.  You cannot call anyone at door dash so I had to chat them about the problem.  They offered me a credit. I refused the credit as I have no intention of every using DoorDash again. After a lot of back and forth I did receive a full refund.

Let‚Äôs say the restaurant you‚Äôre ordering from doesn‚Äôt include your drink and or the dasher takes a fat sip out of it, doordash refunds the item within 7 days depending on your bank and having that safety is essential for a service like this when other services like Uber eats just tells you to eat dirt if anything similar occurs. I have not ran into any complex problem yet but so far tons of dashers have missed my drink and doordash has refunded each penny.

But in the DoorDash version EACH topping has to be selected for $1.99.  So what is one to do?  Call the restaurant and hash it out?  Not very convenient.  And DoorDash is supposed to about paying for convenience.

But the major problem I have with the app is missing/wrong items.  Any restaurant that delivers will correct this by sending the driver back or refunding your money, but with DoorDash you just get stuck with DoorDash credit.  Credit for what?  More wrong orders?  A dasher is supposed to CHECK THE ORDER before leaving the restaurant, but some do and some don‚Äôt - which means you are paying DoorDash‚Äôs convenience premium just for the privilege of rolling the dice every time you use their app.

312,Not worth the trouble - avoid dash pass,False,2021-09-21 20:56:23,1,"Recently while using door Dash, all of the drivers have been picking up multiple orders along with mine. This has led to food being late, cold, and wait times have increased. I understand it could be efficient for the drivers, however the customer ends up losing in the end. The last order, my driver called and said the app sent her to a completely different location, when I read her back the address she confirmed that‚Äôs what was in the app, but it took her to someplace completely wrong so the door dash GPS system messed up. I used to really like door dash, even though it‚Äôs more expensive, because of the convenience. Now however, it just seems like I‚Äôm waiting longer for more expensive food that ends up at my door cold. I also have the dash pass and for a service that you pay for, I would expect better. But if I‚Äôm going to get the same crappy service with drivers picking up multiple orders instead of just mine, then what is the point of the dash pass? There should be an option in the app to opt out of allowing your driver to pick up multiple orders if you have dash pass. If I‚Äôm ordering food, I would expect that you pick it up and bring it straight to me, not drive all over the city with it.",whydoineedanicknameforthis.,
313,Too many unacceptable instances,False,2021-03-10 22:41:47,2,"Door dash is generally okay, but I have had too many unacceptable things happen that I just cannot recommend anyone use this app. Some examples: A dasher once took my phone number from the app and used it to harass me. They tried texting me inappropriate things and when I didn‚Äôt respond, they began to call me. I ended up blocking the number and didn‚Äôt use the app for a good while after that because I was afraid of getting the same dasher. Another time a dasher picked up my food and sat in their car for so long the actual restaurant called me to let me know he hadn‚Äôt left. They ended up giving the dasher a fresh version of my order. When the dasher finally l arrived to deliver my food, he yelled at me for how the restaurant treated him. The final straw has been this last time where the dasher stole my order and picked up something from a convenient store and delivered that instead. This does not count the amount of times my order has been messed up or items have been missing, because I can see where that may have been the restaurants fault, but after all that I cannot bring myself to use this app again and I definitely cannot recommend anyone else use this app.",Lgomien,
314,"Pretty good, but serious flaw",False,2021-01-09 16:53:20,2,"The only thing that is really flawed (besides the 30% extra you pay for food) is the fact that there is no mechanism to correct an incorrect order being delivered. And no, refunding the money does not count- that person still does not have the food they ordered. 
I do not understand why the driver cannot be sent back to the restaurant to recover what was forgotten- instead the customer is refunded their money and left without food.  Really does not make any sense. And I do understand that the delivery driver incurs costs when returning for a forgotten item however if the customer was not being raked over the coals with fees for every order- maybe then they would be able to budget a decent tip for the driver.  
Biggest issue is refunding money instead of just making the order whole. It is one thing to forget a side of dressing, but I have literally had whole dinners not included and all I get in return is ‚Äúwe will refund your money in 7-10 business days‚Äù.

So frustrated. Habit doesn‚Äôt have a phone apparently, I was transferred to online ordering service TWICE. Then they transferred me to Door Dash phone service. Door Dash wouldn‚Äôt give me Habit‚Äôs phone number. Said they would put in the request for me. Was called two minutes later and told they could not make alterations on orders already made.

We have been able to try some local restaurants we would have never found by ourselves.  The variety is good and it gives my husband control over what he orders and that has been so good for him.   When many women were learning to cook, I was working two jobs and went to school full time to earn my doctorate.  I have congenital anosmia and cannot smell if food is burning or spoiled.  One of the reason my husband is doing so well is that he has been able to eat so well with DoorDash.  My guess is when the COVID virus is under control we will try to get out some but will continue to rely on DoorDash for most of our daily meals.

The reason for the delay both times was that after my dasher arrived at the store and set off with the food all of a sudden it shows they are making an additional delivery before mine. Why was I not notified of that PREVIOUS to paying and why is it adjusting my anticipated delivery time? I might have chosen to order something else had I known the time frame would be different. I am very dissapointed and frustrated that this is continuing to happen and there is not change to the process. I expressed my dissatisfaction the last time this happened and was told there was nothing that could be done but report an issue when I received the order and they would offer a $5 credit. My food was just delivered an our and a half late, the food was cold and the order is completely wrong. I expressed that to the driver and he doesn't speak English and can't help me.

324,"Convenient, fairly easy food ordering",False,2020-07-13 18:46:02,4,"So the ability to order food from an app is awesome. I‚Äôve only ordered using Door Dash or other options a few times in the last couple years but I‚Äôve yet to have a bad experience. If a business doesn‚Äôt delivery food internally, they might us the delivery/app service to get Here‚Äôs the only reason(s) I don‚Äôt rate 5-stars. These businesses typically take a small portion of the sale which means in some, maybe most cases, the restaurant you‚Äôre ordering from is losing some of their profit. Also, you typically pay a delivery fee and then you‚Äôre looking to tip the driver. So your $10 meal quickly becomes $18. That being said, if you‚Äôre willing to pay the premium for delivery, then go for it. But as Joe Taffer (Bar Rescue) said recently: during the COVID problem, if your restaurant you want food from has direct ordering, you‚Äôll do them a favor by ordering direct. You‚Äôll save a few bucks too but obviously do as you will here. DD is nice for businesses that don‚Äôt have delivery options.

325,Pretty good but missing features,False,2020-07-09 01:10:02,4,"Gets the job done and looks pretty good doing it, but the lack of a dark mode makes the DoorDash app feel like it‚Äôs stuck in 2018. The lack of a menu search within individual restaurant pages makes it hard to find specific items for a given restaurant, especially now that they‚Äôve added several convenience store options with massive inventories. They have layers of categorization that helps a bit, but it‚Äôs still a pain. It‚Äôs especially disappointing given individual items can be found through the general search function, and are seeking a LOT more data to do so.

I used to have a lot of problems with promotions activating on the app, but that seems to be resolved or at least greatly reduced in the past half year.

One last thing that won‚Äôt apply to everyone but is worth noting: there needs to be an iPad app. It‚Äôs pretty jarring to use DoorDash on iPad in 2020 and have it just be a blurry, scaled up phone app. The DoorDash website features dynamic scaling and presents a tablet-friendly layout when accessed in browser, which makes the app omission especially head-scratching",CaseyPoney,
326,Meh,False,2020-06-07 13:09:01,2,"The app is misleading. Restaurants will advertise promos through banners. For example, ‚Äú$0 delivery on orders over $10‚Äù or ‚Äú20% off on first order up to $5‚Äù. There‚Äôs regular looking banners and then dashpass banners. What they don‚Äôt tell you is any and all promos by restaurants only applies to dashpass users if the restaurant is a participating dashpass restaurant. Meaning, even if a restaurant advertises free delivery using a regular, non-dashpass banner, you will NOT get that promo or any promo if you do not pay for dashpass. I lost a few bucks when customer service said there was nothing they can do.

In a nutshell, what you have to do if you want to use promos is to scroll through the list of restaurants to find ones that do NOT have the check mark for ‚Äúdashpass‚Äù. Then you can use their promo. Do NOT base it on the type of banner they use to advertise. Two customer service reps confirmed this when I tried to get my delivery fee back. Sadly, practically all the restaurants in my area are dashpass participants, so I cannot take advantage of ANY promos from pretty much all restaurants in my area unless I pay monthly for dashpass.

The app also offers no way to leave feedback on the restaurant, food, or drivers. The app has inaccurate arrival times. It also can get glitchy and crash.",Gamer13892647,

A lot of the time they don‚Äôt include utensils and a lot of drivers seem to just ignore delivery instructions.

I‚Äôve gotten calls saying that they‚Äôre in the lobby and don‚Äôt want to come up which is whatever. Besides that, I‚Äôve also gotten a call because there was no answer when they instructions say to knock and they didn‚Äôt knock. Random stuff like that, but that‚Äôs more on drivers than the app.

Bad part of the app is that they ask you for a tip and the tip is delivered to your driver before your order. Certain other apps deliver the tip some time afterwards, but this one is weird. I don‚Äôt mind tipping and always include one but tipping before you order or get something delivered is weird and can be awkward since apparently it alerts them if you change it.

After spending my whole break on the phone they gave me CREDIT back.( MY BREAK IS OVER). So fast forward to today I am a single mother of two no car, no job and I don‚Äôt receive state benefits. I ordered me some food from one place (ingredients on the order was wrong luckily) and my kids some food from another place. They canceled my kids food so I tried to go in and cancel the whole order (drinks and 5 wings= $17) it was going to allow me but not give me my money back. So I messaged and called customer care. The chat team refused to give me any  of my money back but the phone team gave me $10 credit. My kids ate my food I ordered Nashville hot chicken but instead bbq came in so luckily they got a chance to eat but I did not.  And yes I did express to the customer service team my situation. Obviously they don‚Äôt care",Maddenmobilesuckz,

There was always the usual - this is taking 30 minutes longer than the original delivery time or why is my driver going all over town after picking up my food. But this past month was the worst. My DoorDash orders have been cancelled multiple times without reason. That‚Äôs annoying. DoorDash gave me a credit and refunded my money but now I‚Äôve been waiting for two hours and am hangry. That‚Äôs not very helpful. But yesterday put me over the edge. My DoorDash account was hacked. Someone 300+ miles away from me ordered over $500 worth of food from multiple restaurants. DoorDash never sent me a text or any sort of message questioning why I was ordering so far away from home. Thankfully I saw the emails confirming that the orders had been placed. I had to wait 10 minutes in the app for a virtual assistant to let them know about the unauthorized orders. I had to cancel my credit card. Now I‚Äôm worried this hacker has my home address, phone number, email, etc. After cancelling the orders all the virtual assistant could offer was more DoorDash credits. No thank you.

338,Quite possibly worst customer service of all time,False,2020-09-07 22:04:50,1,"I was a very loyal DashPass holder, until suddenly one day they kicked me off the platform claiming I ‚Äúviolated the user agreement‚Äù.

When I reached out to customer service asking what, exactly, I had violated and what I had done to be kicked off the app, their response was ‚Äúyou violated the agreement, and that‚Äôs as much information as we can give you‚Äù. I kid you not. HORRIBLE customer service, wildly vague, and no legitimate reason was ever given. I was furious but obviously wasn‚Äôt going to get anywhere with it... So I deleted the app and moved on.

Suddenly, lo and behold, a month later (AFTER I had deleted the app and moved on to Uber Eats), a $9.99 membership fee from DoorDash appeared in my bank statement. It seems that quietly, without telling me, they reinstated my membership (imagine that... so I did NOT, in fact, vaguely ‚Äúviolate‚Äù your user agreement after all??) and went ahead and charged me for another month of DashPass membership. Without asking me. Unbelievable! 

I‚Äôm back on the app ONLY to get my money‚Äôs worth from that $9.99 they stole from me, but immediately cancelled any future membership with this company. Incredibly disappointing way to handle a very loyal customer.",EM1989,

Said the dasher must of delivered it to another address which I find hard to believe someone would just act as if they ordered food and take it but anyways 3 days later I ordered again because I had credits from the first attempt.  Low and behold it happened again I checked my app and it said the food had been delivered but I had never received my food.  So I reach out to them again and they say they can‚Äôt get ahold of the dasher and they will reimburse me for my order.  This is my thing I‚Äôm grateful they at least reimbursed my money but why should I not get any food and just be wasting my time waiting on food hungry to get nothing and doordash just wants to give me a credit back?  I ordered food because I was hungry and they have such a flawed system that they have no idea if I received my food or not.  Worst delivery experience I‚Äôve ever had and I have credits in my account that I probably won‚Äôt use out of fear of not getting my food.,Basile1122,

Literally no words as I greeted her hello and she just walked off. Okay, I understand - maybe a bad day you can‚Äôt even acknowledge a customer. The second delivery driver never attempted to call as she cancelled my order. (When I say cancel, she said It was confirmed and we were charged and It showed delivered) Okay, I called the number and asked if she needed help locating our door and she legitimately YELLED at us and that she waited 5min and she called multiple times (which she did not once call) and she‚Äôs already gone! she then hung up on us abruptly without us getting a word in. Okay.. We spent A LOT of money on the particular order and a hefty tip for HER so for her to yell at us and hang up is not professional. 

We ended up chatting with customer service and they were nothing but helpful. They knew the true meaning of a customer service job! If only they were the drivers..

After about 10 minutes I got through to a person who could no longer do anything about correcting the order because the driver was already across town. They did offer a $10 credit to my account which I declined preferring to delete the app, but I guess if you like cold food you can get credits by complaining. I prefer a service that delivers at the promised time. If the initial delivery time had have be 8:17 pm which is when the sandwiches arrived cold, I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this.

My first delivery driver showed up to the restaurant and stayed there for over 30 minutes with no communication or explanation as to why, and then just completely disappeared. Then DoorDash said they were looking to find me another dasher, and that took about 30 minutes. By then, it had been an hour since I ordered and it looked like I wouldn‚Äôt get any food soon so I just decided I wanted to cancel, but when I went to cancel, it said they would not give me a refund at all. Even though I had waited so long. So, I waited some more. By the time I got my food, it was around 12:30 am and my food was gross and cold, and they messed up my order.

However on the last occasion the dasher literally delivered the wrong order to me and Door Dash customer service was not going to issue a credit, refund my money or reorder my correct order. Their reason? They said my account showed too many instances where I asked them to correct their screwups. I took pictures of the wrong order and the attached receipt that literally had someone else‚Äôs name and address on it. No luck. They were not budging. They were literally going to steal my money and had no shame about it. After hours digging for their 800# and waiting on the phone I finally got a refund but the experience was jaw dropping.

This avoids a very simple issue that seems to be a serious and quite honestly, ridiculous problem for a company this established to have.

I can see how drivers would get screwed cause after seeing all the other charges your less inclined to leave a good tip for the driver and they are  one of the most important piece of the puzzle.

361,Doordash needs to add a feature to deal with people living on militsry bases,False,2020-10-03 22:58:29,2,"I live on a military base and unfortunately do not have a car. In order to get onto a military base you need a military id that grants you access to the base. Many people living on bases use these food apps because they do not have a gehicle to go and get food with. So due to that they order food to be delivered to them. Unfortunately, not every doordash driver has a military id and so at times they cannot finish the delivery if the food. Ive had many friends whos food was not delivered due ti this and it can be very annoying constantly getting refunds because your driver cannot get on base. I believe that doordash needs to add a feature allowing for doordash drivers to state whether or not they have a military id before picking up the food going onto a military base. This would allow for less occurences where people dont receive their food when someone doesnt have a military id. It would also be less of a nuisance for doordash to deal with always having to refund peoples orders due to failed deliveries. I would like to continue using this app, but until a feature like this is added, i will not be using it due to the unreliability of the food delivery onto the base i live on.",zach.morr,

I love this concept, have used this app at hole and traveling many times. But the fees you charge plus the delivery are too high to justify using the service more regularly. And ai want you to understand ai make of $200k per year and feel its expensive for my family of 4. Now, in addition to this, I‚Äôve had several experiences and one tonight, that are really frustrating to the point that I want to throw my phone and send you the bill. I‚Äôve had issues with location, people saying they don‚Äôt deliver here when they do. Restaurants with DD stickers but can‚Äôt find them on the app. Crazy menu issues. Restaurants not prepared to offer all options on the app like sauces for dipping chicken nuggets. Then they call you last minute and ask what you want through the driver and then it comes and it‚Äôs still wrong. Tonight trying to order sushi and get an error that I can‚Äôt place an order over $100. What the actual F guys?! You DON‚ÄôT want me to spend more money? I can‚Äôt buy a full nice dinner for my family? You‚Äôre going to make me order twice and pay two delivery fees. It‚Äôs unreal. Fix these things or it will kill your company.

Finally a driver just brought me food from a the other location with the same name (not the one the app said I ordered from) considering the distance it was not edible... I had the same thing happen while I was staying in a fairly popular hotel in my area (a chain that doordash should not have a problem finding) the app sent my driver several blocks away.. this time I called the driver myself and walked a few blocks to retrieve my food... it was not very good after the confusion it got soggy and cold. I had hoped that this would improve with time since the app is slightly new to my area but today it happened again... I ordered food for my husband to his work and it took almost 2 hours to get there and was cold and soggy again... the restaurant made a comment to the dasher that it had been sitting there over an hour at the restaurant...

I couldn't cancel the order on the site because it had ""already been sent to the restaurant"" even though obviously it hadn't been because the place was closed. All I got was a form email response saying they'd get back to me in 48 hours. In this day and age this should be unacceptable for an on-demand deliver business. 

I used to order from Doordash a lot, but in recent months it doesn't seem to have as large a selection of restaurants compared to UberEats in SF and takes longer to deliver. Still the only decent option for delivery in some suburbs where UberEats hasn't gone yet but I'm not going to be using them for San Francisco anymore.

So far our orders have been great, the drivers are all very nice and the tracking updates on the food have been wonderful. The only reason I‚Äôm not giving it 5 Stars is because the menus. I am not sure if this is even a doordash thing or someone else‚Äôs in the process but I‚Äôve noticed that from the places I frequent in person there are a lot of menu items that are not on the doordash menu. For example there‚Äôs a cafe I love and normally I get a certain type of bagel but on the doordash menu there‚Äôs not a single one of the bagel options the cafe has. It‚Äôs also a bit annoying that there‚Äôs no description of the food items. When ordering things like Chinese food or such I would like to know what exactly I‚Äôm ordering.

(I didn‚Äôt notice because it allowed me to make the order.) instead of telling me that the order was not on its way, the app just said ‚Äúin progress‚Äù for almost four hours until I cancelled. By the time I realized that that order wasn‚Äôt coming, every restaurant on the app he closed for the night. Of course, I was offered a $5 credit for the inconvenience, which seems ridiculous when you‚Äôve been waiting all night for food. On top of that, when I tried to complain, the app sends you to an internet pop up chat window that cancels out if you do anything else on your phone (like get a text). When you finally talk to a person (careful not to close out the window for any reason), they blame it on the local restaurant. After reviewing the details, it seems clear that doordash is at fouls for not getting the order in on time and then NOT cancelling or notifying me. Overall incredibly frustrating.

For up to maybe a month or two in early spring, I was ordering DoorDash maybe once a week with NO to LITTLE problems. Now since the past month and a half, DoorDash has failed to conduct professional deliveries services. Twice in a row, my order got screwed up- Firstly, one was ordered and took well over an hour and half to get delivered but that was due to the driver delivering to another customer that came after me but was closer to the driver at the time. So my order was basically put on hold, left to get soggy and cold as we were left to wait with no choice. DoorDash apologized and credited $5. Just a measly $5. But whatever, so now in another order today, I used said credits at last (after a month of inactivity) and LO AND BEHOLD! They managed to screwed that up, and my order had an entire order missing along with it. DoorDash solution? Credited back what I was missing. BUT THE CREDITS I USED TO ORDER IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, is gone. This was a total loss really, and the services you get is just horrible. Other food deliveries provided much better services, even bad, as compared to the ethics and conducts DoorDash gives.

Then after 30-40 minutes of ‚Äúyour dasher is at the restaurant picking up your order‚Äù, and over an hour after you ordered, your order is canceled.  Why?  Nobody knows but DoorDash assures you it wasn‚Äôt their fault and don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll get a refund.  You can tell this happens a lot because they don‚Äôt want to give you anything for the inconvenience.  It would probably bankrupt them.  This is all very frustrating because I have ordered dozens of times from Grubhub without an issue and UberEats is prompt in fixing the issues if they come up.  And they don‚Äôt drive off to God knows where or cancel your orders.  My suggestion:  give more realistic delivery times, work on being quicker if you have to get a new dasher for the order, and do more than send a pop-up notification that your order is canceled before deleting all traces that the order was ever placed.

The only note you can leave is for delivery instructions. The first two times I ordered, door dash called me multiple times to ask questions that I thought should have been obvious.

I'd rather order direct from the restaurant and Grub Hub is the next best option.

I also had a delivery never arrive and they couldn't confirm if the driver had made it to my house. which was frustrating and seemed like it should be an easy thing to do. apparently there's no way for them to contact the driver after the delivery is marked as completed. - seems like an obvious blind spot to me. and they said they would submit my ""feedback"" to the driver whereas I feel like they should've tried to figure out if they had stolen my food.

After researching it and looking at countless examples, dashers would actually LOSE money if they the took orders as they appear! I don‚Äôt tip an outrageous or unreasonable amount, but this policy doesn‚Äôt benefit anyone besides DD (who already collects extra fees on top of fees) and customers who don‚Äôt tip. 

No wonder ordinary orders get sidelined when DD doesn‚Äôt incentivize drivers to accept our orders. If DD wants to continue this, they should offset the cost so drivers do get every order. I do believe this is a luxury and we as customers do need to tip, but we should not have to offset the cost. If someone doesn‚Äôt tip or the order payout is low, it‚Äôs on DD, not the drivers, to insure that order is taken care of.

My biggest complaint are the fees. Even with the dash pass, there are times where the fees seem to amount to just as much or more than the actual meal. For example, a simple ice cream and fries ran me close to $17 once I included the tip, which is a bit excessive. I use DoorDash a couple times a week but would probably use the app daily were it not for the fees.

Billing issues keep occurring (app shows a certain amount and they charge a higher amount on the card), the offers they send never get redeemed painlessly.

As time has gone on I‚Äôve also noticed more and more restaurants adding a 1-3$ premium on every menu item, this seems unnecessary and only adds to making doordashing more expensive as free users already are paying service fees taxes and tipping the dasher. I truly feel as though this company is exploiting its users for every cent instead of focusing on improving user experience to drive more app engagement for revenue. (on a side note their customer service representatives are pushy and everything they say is copy pasted it felt more like I was talking with a robot than actual person not to mention that they had told me I would receive doordash credits for my inconveniences which never showed up) Doordash was great and I hope to take back my one star review but for the near future i‚Äôve cancelled my annual subscription and will refrain from using the app.",Taverec,

Instead I cancelled my Dashpass & moved onto other apps who seem to have less mistakes made by the drivers or ask when items are unavailable instead of just picking out new items - Instacart & Grubhub. 

After being a loyal customer with DoorDash who ordered at least 3 times a week off their app for the past two years, I would not recommend using this service since I can promise you have at least a 25% chance of your order being incorrect and Doordash will not be making things right anymore for customers who have experienced issues that were constantly caused by the restaurant and/or the Dasher.",jessiegirl912,

I contacted customer service to figure out if the GPS was just stuck or if he was just completely ignoring it. Half way through that conversation his GPS started moving towards the restaurant. I told them to cancel it since I had already placed another order. So they did that and I noticed Gul was at the restaurant. Then my 2nd order gets picked up by a Danielle and then she starts to move away from the restaurant and stops at the same gas station as Gul 25 miles away and stays there.

I chatted DoorDash up (immediately had customer service ready to help me) and Daisy was so polite and helpful - and apologetic for the mistake.  She quickly offered to refund my dinner.  
We ended our chat but as we began digging into our food, I realized that I had made an awful mistake ‚Äî the order was in fact correct!  So I quickly rechatted DoorDash and explained my error, this time apologizing for MY mistake.

Another time the driver had gotton out of his car and opened up their cooler bag for me to reach into grab the bag of food. I looked down and noticed the bag of food was laying on its side. I pulled the bag out and sauce had poured out and covered everything. It was a mess! I mentioned it to the driver and he blamed the restaurant.

The app doesn‚Äôt update location automatically even though I have it location permission. So when you go from Fresno to Yuma and don‚Äôt physically update your location then your food will get delivered to wherever you were before. Minor issue, I thought. I should have paid better attention, I suppose. I call support to ask about a refund because my food is going to the wrong place and they refused to rectify the situation. I was told I would have to pay for the food no matter what. 
Don‚Äôt get me started on the price markup. In Texas a meal at Jack in the Box will run you maybe $11. With door dash you pay well over $50 for one plate for one person. That‚Äôs a ridiculous price, even for food delivery. Switching to Uber eats or GrubHub. I will never use this app again as well as encourage others to stop using this service.

 Then I called the Wing Stop to cancel but they told me I had to contact DoorDash. I called DoorDash customer service and received a message that online chat was my only option to speak to an agent due to Covid19 (setting up agents to work from home is not hard to do btw). 

There was no online chat anywhere on the website and when I finally figured out how to cancel the order on the app it was too late and I‚Äôm stuck paying $40.

Door dash emailed me that they cancelled my order and to expect a full refund. I called them they said what happened is that they couldn‚Äôt find a driver.  I asked them why would they take the order without a driver to confirm first? What made me mad was that the app never said that, it said contact support for an ETA for your order and there was no way to call anyone because when you click on the headset. It didn‚Äôt do anything. In other words, this app is pointless. It didn‚Äôt allow me to trace my food, follow up, no way to communicate. If I hadn‚Äôt ran to the restaurant myself I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten any food.
The worst part I feel is that they had those two women alone in the store just waiting. We live in a bad neighborhood with lot of homeless people addicted to drugs or with mental issues.

Another 30 mins goes by and there‚Äôs still no food. The customer service rep states they are reordering the food and compensate me for my inconvenience. After 4 hours or so I finally get the $60 food that was good but cold. A week later I still see the $60 charge on my bank account and notice there is no compensation.

442,Higher Menu Prices,False,2019-06-07 18:00:59,5,I love the concept of DoorDash and I have always had good service. But the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I don‚Äôt agree with the higher Menu prices on DoorDash than what‚Äôs really the price at the restaurants. And if there‚Äôs any Sales or Specials going on at the restaurant in my opinion those Sales should be available on DoorDash also. For Example if Checkers has 2 for $5 chicken sandwiches at the restaurant. You have to pay $4 or $5 Per sandwich on DoorDash to me this is Misleading and feels like borderline scamming people but just my opinion I would much rather pay for a yearly membership upfront that would get my deliveries for free and my food at REAL cost the Restaurants charge rather than being misleading and what I call being Sneaky if you‚Äôre Not paying attention. I know DoorDash has to make money I just feel why Not be straight up about it and just give people a 30 day Trial of the App followed by a yearly membership and then the Menu Items can be the real cost just as if you were there at the Restaurant??

Gone through the customer support rigamarole. Email and phones. Email, they copy paste some default response. On the phone they can't understand you, never deviate from their script even if it is to help you understand more, and unprofessionally hang up, keep you on a hold without notice for over 15 minutes, lie and promise things that they can't make good on, and overall make it a horrible experience.

Last Friday I ordered Denny‚Äôs for $51 + change. They charged my card 11 times taking $600 out of my account. BofA said they couldn‚Äôt do anything because the charges processed and the money had gone back in. Fool, I had a noticeable difference in my account. So don‚Äôt tell me they haven‚Äôt stolen this money from me. This has happened over and over again but they get away with it once that transaction falls off. Tried switching to Grubhub. Boom! They charged my card 5 times and get away with $120. 
So far no such issue with Uber eats except they‚Äôre remarkably more expensive. 
This is an ongoing issue. I highly recommend avoiding this company in every way, they fail. Their dashers don‚Äôt give a ^@!& about you or your food issues. Not to mention the support staff spits out the same tired narrative as an excuse for what they‚Äôve done.

That being said, I tried to order once and after an hour noticed the drivers car was stationary for 10 or so minutes. Assuming he was making another delivery, I checked back after 30 or so minutes, and he was still not moving. So I called the driver, and he said the restaurant was closed. I called the restaurant and they were very much open, and that my order had been done and waiting for almost an hour. So I called the driver back to relay that information, and he said he couldn‚Äôt find the restaurant and he was off his shift. I asked if he could tell that to DoorDash so another driver could be assigned. Nothing happened for another 20 minutes. I messaged DoorDash support, and in all fairness, their chat responds quickly.

And I‚Äôve always been able to go into the order and speak with someone and resolve the issue either with a refund or a replacement order. My only complaint or suggestion would be to make the tip be after the food is delivered. For example my driver tonight was amazing followed the delivery directions to the the section of the hospital where deliveries are supposed be, super polite actually got out of his car to meet me. I would have loved to give him a better tip for that excellence. But some drivers sit in the car and wait for you to figure out they are here with a delivery most of them show up to the wrong section of the hospital.

Then I searched the app and didn‚Äôt find a cancel or report the issue button. So I called the customer service. 

There are two things that I was not happy about. First, DoorDash as an app should have a program to detect any weird delays so they could dispatch a new dasher to pick up the order. Maybe they do have it, but in my case it apparently failed. Second, customer service should provide credit back to customers under circumstances like this.

Luckily for me my place of employment is very accommodating but this is really inconveniencing me and anyone who has to cover my place while I am on break.

I understand that things happen and I honestly wasn‚Äôt upset about the order not being delivered, but the way the issue was addressed (or not addressed rather) was incredibly disappointing and I will be deleting my account/the app after this experience.

I have no problem with DoorDash charging whatever fee they think the market will bear, but it is an evil business practice to hide the fact that there are fees until up at the moment you‚Äôre about to place your order. I bet lots of people never even notice the ‚ÄúService Fee‚Äù if they‚Äôre not the type to add totals in their head as they go ‚Äî they‚Äôd just assume the food or the tax cost that much.

How are we supposed to trust DoorDash is a safe place to order if you can‚Äôt protect your own customers information. And on top of that the person was yelling that they got only 5% of whatever amount I had originally tipped. DoorDash, if you are going to steal the tip amount from your employees at least be transparent about how much you are taking instead of putting your customers in a difficult position.

How can someone run a business like this? You hire random people to trust with delivering your food?

Last night I ordered food at 8:30 (26 minute estimated delivery time).  30 minutes later my driver was at the opposite end of town delivery another order and said 33 minutes expected time to arrive.

I have numerous ideas for upgrades and to enhance user experience and I write to them all the time but no one listens. As a driver, you have to take three steps on the app just to get someone from support on the line and it‚Äôs often very hard to understand the associates in their call center.

Tonight I tried to order food, but knowing that it would be a busy night, I placed the order before 6pm and requested a delivery time of 7pm. By 8pm my pregnant wife and 2 kids were getting antsy to say the least. The app seemed to sporadically jump around insisting that the order was 1 minute away with the driver at the restaurant, and then it would change its mind and state that the wait time 18 minutes and that the restaurant was just now preparing the food. The app timeframe jumped around erratically until the order was abruptly cancelled at 8:30pm without any consultation. All I received was an email stating that I would receive a refund, which is was an inconvenience for me, and the lack of food was an even bigger one for my family. Mistakes happen and sometimes supply can‚Äôt meet demand. I understand that, but what infuriates me is the lack of communication and deliberate coverup by door dash. I have been unable to get a hold of any support via chat. The email form was having errors and wouldn‚Äôt process, and now my order that was cancelled doesn‚Äôt even show in the app!

It eventually got frustrating as the drivers started to make less of an effort to find our apartment & some would be at other complexes refusing to drive to the actual one we live in. We stopped using the app for about 6 months because we were so frustrated spending 20 minutes trying to even find the driver at our complex. Now as we redownloaded the app we will be deleting it once again because our order estimated 30-40 minutes. Got the notification that the driver picked up our order and was headed to us & then we watched for almost 30 minutes our driver go the total opposite direction & stop elsewhere not moving. When he finally texted back he said he was dropping off another persons order which is understandable except now our food is cold & 30 minutes late. The driver was probably a 10 minute drive from our food to our home & instead drove 20 minutes the wrong direction. Honestly screw this app, don‚Äôt tell people your food is picked up and on the way when you are going to complete an order in a completely different direction.

  Finally the food arrives cold. 
I received a call from Brothers BBQ saying that they were out of ribs . I could ask for a refund or get a 2 for one plate. I asked how to get a refund or cancel order they didn‚Äôt know . So I decided to take their offer. 
  The coleslaw was liquid. All the meats were chopped as though You were feeding a child. I expected a piece of brisket, a piece of chicken, a whole links of sausage not ground meat.

First of all, I ordered from a restaurant that I go to regularly. The prices on the app were a bit higher than I remembered and I confirmed it that the prices are elevated. They then charge a 15% service fee for the app after already raising the normal prices. Yes, they do remove the delivery fee which is minimal compared to the service fee. But then you still tip the driver before you even finish the order. So, you have already paid for good service even before you get it. So, in my situation, the driver didn‚Äôt even bother to check the order as I have seen so many other service drivers do before they leave the restaurant. Then it gets here with about half my order plus part of what did come was wrong. Then, you can report a problem but the only solution is to credit your account. I don‚Äôt want a credit for a service that can‚Äôt get the basics right. I won‚Äôt be using them again.

Then suddenly the delivery time goes back to 37-47 minutes and my dasher is different. I text the person who says they only just got my order. When I said I had placed it about an hour ago now, they said someone must have dropped the order and that they would arrive ASAP. (37-47min per the app) this isn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôm not mad at the second dasher, it‚Äôs obviously not his fault, but you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to just drop an order like that. Had I been told I would have almost a 2hr wait for food I never would have ordered and would have just gone out to get something. Eventually I was able to get my order canceled (I assume my dasher did it as I asked how I could do that), but not before I waited about an hour and a half, because it wasn‚Äôt letting me cancel my own order.

I work long hours and frequently forget (or am just so tired that I don‚Äôt want to) go to the store to make something for lunch. I just order from Door Dash and they bring it right to me. The best features (IMO) are the real time map and driver icon that shows you exactly where your driver is and how long it will be until they arrive. This makes my job so much easier because the nursery is upstairs and I can make sure the kids are asleep when the driver arrives, plus I can open the door before the driver rings the doorbell. 
  I also like that I can text the driver directly if I need something that isn‚Äôt on the menu (i.e. extra napkins or utensils). I can also put their tip right on my card so I don‚Äôt have to worry about having cash on hand. It also tells you the delivery fees and approximate wait times for each restaurant before you order.

But recently doordash has altered several of their menus so it means i cannot re order very simple orders i have before. For example about an hour ago i put out an order for Mcdonalds and ordered some nuggets, a quarter pounder, a single cheeseburger, and two large fries. I got the nuggets, quarter pounder, and the cheeseburger. The former two had no issues but the cheeseburger wasn‚Äôt done enough but thats on the store itself not door dash. However, with the two large fries lies the issue. I only got one fry...and it was small. Door dash changes their menus to make it so you cant order specifically one thing you have to one other thing in order to order that specific item. So i added the first fries to the nuggets and again with the quarter pounder. Not only did it not give me the correct number of my item it flat out got them wrong. And its not only for McDonald‚Äôs, they switch up their menus and make it extremely inconvenient. So bottom line you‚Äôll get your food, but it might not always be right",GBalf,

If you don‚Äôt believe me, make an order without a Dash Pass then make an order with. For $10 a month, they‚Äôre making a bigger profit.

My very last order tonight was for Burger King, waited more than the advertised time of 55mins, and I checked the app it says driver arriving to location when it shows him on the map at Taco Bell, not at Burger King, instead of DoorDash sending a different driver , I asked for my order to be canceled, spoken with DoorDash manager Maria Angelica Mora N, It is intentionally done by DoorDash back staff that is putting in the order, and dispatching the drivers, it‚Äôs that person that caused my family to skip the meal we paid for because you don‚Äôt follow protocol, Food handlers permit should be required, no gloves, no mask, or it‚Äôs not a good idea to ride around with peoples food, when it expresses you are on the way, if you don‚Äôt care about that then, Consumers you were warned, Totally unsafe actions taken too frequently and management covers",123 Boss Life,

So even though there are preferred drivers who may have base access, the driver can‚Äôt see that information (even if it‚Äôs in the delivery instructions) until they have already accepted to complete the order. By then, it could be someone who literally can‚Äôt complete the order because they don‚Äôt have the clearance. I would recommend updating any settings so that drivers can at least see the instructions or notes before accepting and wasting their time trying to complete the order when there is no way for them to do so. This happened to a friend of mine, and she had the delivery for over an hour for virtually no tip, and the person who ordered wouldn‚Äôt answer their phone. Could certainly make it easier for active military, and on the drivers. Better efficiency and better effectiveness. Could serve more people, and increase business.

I genuinely believe if there isn‚Äôt a dasher in the area there should be some sort of system to cancel the order where you get back more than your tip and delivery fee. If at 20 minutes for example there‚Äôs still no dasher, someone should contact you and offer to refund those things and change the order to take out. Simply because the restaurant tells you to talk to door dash it‚Äôs there problem and door dash will say ‚Äú well you have to pay for your food. They made it for you‚Äù and you are in a loose loose situation. They should track the drivers only once they‚Äôve accepted an order.

A lot of the missing items were on the receipt from reputable restaurants but mysteriously missing from my order. No one seems to actually check the order at the restaurant.

Probably working other apps at the same time. When I first got the app and dashpass, about 6 months ago, I would have given the service 5 stars.

I have used it for a while and most of the orders take an hour or more to arrive (though I live in a very populated area) and about ten minutes before they say it should arrive, I get a push notification that they cancelled my order. On some of the orders, I have had to call in just to make sure that I get my money back and not sent to the app as credit! They offer no reason. They offer no apology credit. There is no excuse for pretending your service offers things it can‚Äôt uphold. If the service does not work in an area, it shouldn‚Äôt be offered. Waiting ten minutes before arrival to inform the customer that there family‚Äôs plans for dinner that evening are out the window is unacceptable. And there is no contact information on the Doordash website if you have an issue. I have never spoken with anyone at the actual company (other than noisy out-of-country call centers) no matter how bad the issue was. The customer service is awful. Dismissive and rude. They did nothing about these multiple issues and merely said that the technicians were working on resolving those issues. It‚Äôs a waste of time and money!",DLXSteve,

Every time this has happened, it has been because of a language barrier. It‚Äôs truly a shame because I love the idea of the app and the jobs that it gives, but without proper communication between the deliverer and recipient, it can be very frustrating to try and get your food delivered. I wish that there was a way to ensure that the deliverers could communicate with the customers as this has been a recurring issue.

The driver apologized and I understood that the roads were covered in snow, and that he was busy, but I couldn‚Äôt leave a review on the app itself. So that‚Äôs why I am writing this one, they up the delivery charge because of roads or because of busy times, ok but they should also notify you that times may be a lot longer due to traffic and road conditions. I show my appreciation for the driver through my tip. The first 2 time I used the app service was great and I will continue to use door dash.

Contrary to popular belief that competitors services (GrubHub UberEats...etc.) are better I was willing to delve into uncharted food delivery territory and get my feet wet in what DoorDash may offer me. This cordial token of $7.00 off of my first purchase was definitely one of the determining favors into me choosing DoorDash as a new food delivery option. After some hassle regarding creating my account,( not blaming that on you guys I get that happens sometimes, no biggie!) I logged on for the first time and the copious amount of food options blew my 17 year old mind. All of my favorite restaurants were on there! (To include a few...

The map shows the location and I‚Äôm confused as to how the complete other side of the city is ‚Äúon the way‚Äù from a restaurant 2 miles from my house. Customer service has no regard for how disgusting it is to get cold food that‚Äôs been sitting in a driver‚Äôs car for over an hour while they rack up on other deliveries, and it‚Äôs super frustrating to wait for hours for an order, essentially putting your whole evening on hold. Even more frustrating if the food is inedible. Plus, it‚Äôs annoying to have to choose your tip for the driver before you ever even interact with them.

We‚Äôve received food that seemed to have been opened before it reached our door. We‚Äôve also had drivers that will say, quite literally, NOTHING when at the door and simply hand the food and speed off before a question can be asked. We‚Äôve also failed to receive receipts on several occasions and had to reach out to the merchant directly to receive it.

Many times there were items missing, which is the most common problem. Today, a main item was missing, and instead of taking a refund, I asked for the item to be delivered. I waited over an hour and then watched the delivery in real time online as the driver went to another neighborhood and stayed at one location for an hour. She eventually started moving and delivered the cold, soggy item to me. When I asked her about it, she said the address was wrong.

Honestly I consider this to be an unethical and incompetent company at best and a malicious and dishonest company at best.

This was my most recent comment to the door dash customer service line which is incredibly difficult to find due to their intentional desire to hide it. I‚Äôve waited for 30 minutes in the phone before just to find out the delivery isn‚Äôt coming and get refunded exactly the amount I purchased in door dash credit which I then have attempted to use for a new delivery weeks later and still not been able to receive my delivery order.

The safety seal on the plastic packaging of the food was broken as well. I got on the Door Dash support chat on the mobile app and after about 7 minutes I was fully credited on the app and could re-order my food. Although not getting my food as planned originally was not ideal, the speed of getting refunded and being able to use that credit to order again on the app was perfect.

The help system is quick to respond whenever you file a complaint but, usually, they just give you a couple of dollars of DoorDash credit as compensation. Like, wow, thanks, I can use this credit to order another meal that‚Äôll probably have half of the stuff missing.

In addition to this, I wish there was an option (similar to Uber) where you can opt out of your driver stopping to pick up another order on the way to deliver yours. While it helps the driver, if you‚Äôre waiting on a hot meal, or even just a quick meal, sometimes I‚Äôd rather pay more to have it come straight to me or get a discount if I‚Äôm okay with them stopping.

So we made another order for another restaurant and despite entering the address to start the account once we pressed save, enter go it charged the card and then said it was delivering to the other restaurant. When we tried to edit all it allowed was comments. You need at least one or two prompts to confirm delivery address
So we call the restaurant and give our address only to find an angry man at my door with a mask on asking me to fix the problem bc he cannot clear the address either unless he goes there. Cell phones are the worst for passing germs btw. I was standing at my door holding hot drinks that burned my hand telling him I tried to change it but it wouldn‚Äôt.

Now though I‚Äôve come back to use the app and this has been an issue ever since, so roughly 8 months. Whenever I place an order now the driver will stack orders in an attempt to make a decent wage. This has been backed by a person I know who says that 1 order at a time just simply isn‚Äôt worth or enough for the drivers so they stack their orders in order to compensate. Wherever the flaw lies is none of my concern, if I‚Äôm paying a good amount of money, plus tip, I expect that the order be here within a decent amount of time so that the meal is still enjoyable, not some cold food that I have to heat up after I get the delivery.

The ""manager"" of cousins called back and said the driver came back to the store and he gave her the updated phone number. She gave him her number to give to me but when I called it said it was no longer in service. This is a nightmare! Apparently the driver said she thought it was a scam? At least that is what the cousins guy said. How the heck is it a scam when I called the store back and said I gave the wrong phone number! I guess you can't deliver to a correct address if the phone number is wrong. I can't even anymore. I hope this goes out to someone and takes notice of this warning.

533,*Edited* Should Be Your Go-To,False,2022-04-16 20:36:28,3,"Man I forgot sometimes doordash makes their drivers do two deliveries at once. Just pay the drivers more, we know you can afford it. I ordered a hot sandwich, driver picked up another order and is delivering it before mine, sandwich is gonna be so soggy lol. There should be a wait and save discount for this instead of paying full delivery fees for a drive that ends up twice as long

I don‚Äôt know how well doordash compensates their restaurants, but as a former driver, this is the best app for you to use to support delivery drivers if you can‚Äôt order straight through the restaurant‚Äôs website. This is the only app, that I know of, that tells the drivers how much they will make for their trip before they accept an order. I used to deliver for postmates also, and they don‚Äôt tell you how much you make until after delivery. I had a lot of hour long orders where I only made $3-6 dollars per order. I stopped doing postmates deliveries entirely because one doordash order was generally twice as good of pay as two postmates orders, not sure if it‚Äôs still that way.",Big Jimbo M,
534,Scam service,False,2021-07-16 17:22:24,1,"Doordash is awful. They do not care about their customers or their drivers. Just their pockets. They pay drivers $2.50-$3.00 per delivery, even on 10+ mile orders. Gas is $3 a gallon alone. They hide the full customer tip from the driver so a lot of orders are being declined. If you tipped well for good service just remember doordash is hiding that from the driver. For example you tip $15 for 8 miles and most drivers would jump on it but doordash only shows $7 which no longer makes it worth it. They up charge the prices at restaurants on top of a service fee and most of you pay a tip on top of it. By the end of it you‚Äôre paying almost double what you should. As for the people complaining about wrong items, please remember most of these restaurants are still sealing orders up so someone can not check it. They can ask if it‚Äôs all there but it just leads to an attitude and a snappy yes. So IF it‚Äôs sealed and the items are wrong that‚Äôs the restaurants fault. Don‚Äôt rate your drivers low for things beyond their control. There‚Äôs also a lot of rumors doordash is stealing tips as well. Can‚Äôt get your order? Blame doordash and their greedy ways.

Wait times became longer. The dashers became more and more stupid.

Do you know how many houses in my town have a metal blue roof? ZERO. I ended up getting so frustrated that I signed up to be a driver just to see how difficult it could possibly be. It wasn‚Äôt. Then the icing on the cake... normally I get 70+ restaurants that I can order from, but starting last week I noticed that my number has went down to 22. Thought maybe it was a bug and called customer service. Their response (which I could barely understand) was that I should maybe try ordering in ‚Äúprivate browsing mode‚Äù next time.

My expected wait time was 30-45 minutes. My driver went to the restaurant in a timely manner 30ish minutes but then left without picking up the food. Drove around chicago for about an hour to and hour and a half doing what i guess would be some other ride service to make money on top of the money from my order. Then only went back to the restaurant after i messaged what seemed like a robot on this stupid app. So she went back to the restaurant and got the food 2 hours later. She dropped it off missing a good portion of the order and the rest was so gross and soggy since it had been sitting for a couple hours at the restaurant that it was uneatable.

I paid for my order and it took longer than usual to process my order which I though whatever of and then it took me out of the processing screen and took me back to the checkout screen. I then saw that it already charged me for the order and the order was not processed. Okay no worries I‚Äôll just call doordash and they can help me fix it right? Very wrong. I called and after being on hold for 15 minutes someone finally picked up and when I told them about the issue they told me to contact the bank to make sure I wasn‚Äôt charged and that I shouldn‚Äôt have been charged. I told them that I was ALREADY CHARGED and then she put me on hold for another 15 minutes. After replying to email she had sent me with my card info she then proceeded to put me on hold yet again for 10 minutes. At this point my lunch break was already over and when she finally got back to the phone she told me it would take 2 business days to further the ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù. What do you need to investigate?? I‚Äôve spent hundreds on this service and they will never see a penny more from me. Uber eats/ postmates here I come.,Fahed Khan,

After 1 1/2 hours of waiting, I tried to cancel through the app and it was not an active option. Then after doing the live chat for support, the representative actually could not give me a reason as to why the food from a restaurant 15 minutes from my house was 2 hours late. The driver showed up and acted oblivious to the delay.  Keep in mind, this is just my latest issue. Good luck if you use this app.

FYI, since the developer contacted me, they have yet to follow through on their promise. I am about to send my third email back to them, in response to this follow up from the developer.

Whether it hides my number or not is not visible though. The latest issue is their refund policy. Order missing food ? Want a refund ? Well - the app only gives you ‚Äúcredits‚Äù now. You have to spam support in a back channel to get ‚Äúreal money‚Äù refunds now. Grubhub, or directly ordering with the vendor, is much better.

OLD REVIEW: There are many delivery apps to choose from, so what differentiates apps for me is the quality of the drivers. A couple bad and concerning experiences with dashers make me think they don't train or pay their drivers enough, and also dont provide enough abstraction between the customer and Dasher for safety purposes. I want better Dasher training, screening, and pay so there is a better delivery experience. Some dashes are great, and some are just downright awful. I want Dashers to NOT get my personal cell number. I've tried tipping extra to get better drivers - and that doesn't seem to work either. When it works, it works. When it doesn't - it's bad/scary/unsafe.",Kevin 72638393,

However if I try to use it on my iPad, it is exactly the same size as on the phone with big black bars around the app screen. It is not sizable and does not rotate as every other app I use does. Also, on the phone once I get to the active delivery map, you $10 Invite friends ad (which won‚Äôt go away whether by waiting or tapping elsewhere on the screen) and blocks the functional part of the map, especially as I need to expand the map to see the route they are coming.

One of the drivers was beyond rude to me and threatened me saying ""I know where you live."" Of course the dashers are to take none of the responsibility for incorrect orders. What I was told by a dasher is they don't even get a list of what items were ordered by the customer. There needs to be someone double checking the orders to insure they are correct. Also, my food always seems cold. They don't keep the food in something that preserves the heat. As I type this I am heating up an incorrect order in my oven. I have no drink to go with my order because they forgot it. This happens with most of the places I order from so I'm thinking the dashers are messing it up when they pick up more than one order from the same place. I hope this company can iron out the kinks as this service has the potential to be great. But for now it's garbage and I would try another delivery service.",davidvlh,

On the app it said it would take about 29 minutes for the order to get to my house. I waited and waited and waited just for a driver to pick my food up. My food finally arrived at 4:25am. Almost 2 hours after I made the order. 2 hours is a lot longer than the ‚Äúexpected delivery time of 29 minutes. I usually get my food faster but this was just unacceptable.

The restaurant owner confirmed the order had been sitting for over 40 minutes waiting to be picked up and now cold. Every restaurant is lying? Ridiculous.

I noticed that DoorDash stopped including the estimated times in order emails, so that it‚Äôs easier to dispute when a person calls in and complains. But I made a note of the time estimate and I verified with the restaurant my order was still sitting there in the bag. Their software causally blames the restaurant on the customer side by implying the order is still cooking, but lets the restaurant know the pickup is late, playing both sides against each other and they look like the good ones. It should say. YOUR ORDER IS READY BUT OUR DRIVER IS LATE, WE‚ÄôRE SORRY which is the truth. Many restaurants have told me how other orders get picked up by competitors right away.

It would‚Äôve been nice if doordash just told me there were no drivers to get my food.  The tip was for $20 for a 10 min drive, so I thought it was a pretty good deal for the driver.

On other occasions, had missing items, food delivered to wrong address, driver did not follow instructions to text or ring doorbell to make sure food was delivered to the right place.  On another order, the driver could not find my location and gave up... maybe they didn‚Äôt have GPS?  I gave two stars because doordash did give me refunds for items not delivered and a refund + small credit for the order that was not delivered at all.

On top of that I‚Äôd say about 1/4 of the orders have either something missing, something wrong, or take forever to arrive. It is convenient to be able to order lunch at work and not leave. That is it. The convenience does not out weigh the hassle of getting the wrong thing, or missing items. Getting a credit back is not ok either, because it forces me to use the app again. I want my money back because now I have to leave and get my own lunch which was the whole point of using door dash to begin with. The drivers could do a better job at checking the # of items in the order, but outside of that they can‚Äôt confirm the order is accurate.

Second, I once placed an order to a restaurant that DID NOT EXIST and almost didn‚Äôt get a refund for it. To sum it up, I order a 35 dollar meal from a ‚Äúphilly cheesesteak restaurant‚Äù and once arriving at the listed address for pick up, I was at a bank. I call the supposed phone number for the restaurant and nothing. Not even a ring. So I go home and contact DoorDash and was sent through 3 different customer service reps.

Dashers are seemingly cancelling orders repeatedly in order to get better pay for their deliveries. While I understand that they want more money for their job, this is collectively screwing over both businesses and consumers in the process. Countless times I have had Dashers accept and cancel an order I placed, claiming the store was closed at 1 pm on a weekday. Likewise, i‚Äôve made food for a Dasher to pick up and seen it take literal HOURS for a Dasher to finally accept the order and come to pick it up. With all that being said, I cannot in my right mind recommend anyone use DoorDash to order their food or as a business partner. If you want to wait over an hour and a half for a pizza, use DoorDash.

I have attempted to manually delete all items, however, it refuses to delete them and I cannot place a new order without purchasing my new order and the old one.

I have trouble shooted every single possible request such as uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone and it refuses to go away. I refuse to purchase something I do not want- yet there is ZERO customer service for people attempting to fix a glitch in their checkout.

VULNERABLE: We have two friends (separately), both tech savvy (one works in tech), who had their accounts compromised and had food delivered to multiple locations in other states.

That was the FIRST time I reported a wrong delivery. At least I got something of a refund the second time they screwed up, however half of my order was wrong and all they could offer was 1/4 refund. The least you could do is refund half since half was wrong. 

I selected a promotion for a free month of DashPass and my account got locked. Since getting a hold of anyone is impossible, I created a new account. AGAIN when I selected the promotion, my account got locked. It took me two hours just to get it straightened out and then they wouldn‚Äôt give me the promotion, even though I had screenshots.

When it comes to receiving food delivery on time this is quite critical and I have reached the point of not trusting them again with deliveries.

The service seems to have an issue when they are short on drivers. The app will provide you an ETA and even report your Dasher picked the order and it‚Äôs on their way, only to inform you later that the Dasher is ‚Äòcompleting another delivery‚Äô, and then pick up your food. On the three occasions this ocurred I ended up having to cancel as the order got serious delays ranging from one hour twenty minutes to over two and a half hours...(yes, I ordered at 11:30am, received an estimated time of 35-45 minutes only to keep receiving delay updates which placed my meal delivery at 2:45pm) so I had a starving group of colleagues in the office.

Every time I have ever ordered the delivery is estimated to be 25-35 minutes or less. It always takes almost an hour if not an hour. The latest order was the last straw. There is no convenience ordering overpriced COLD food. Speaking of prices, they upcharge EVERYTHING upfront in addition to adding tax, delivery fee, an 18% ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù and tip. I tried to get a bunch of coworkers together to order food thinking it would be a little cheaper overall. NOPE. I ended up paying almost $90!! For a meal that should cost $40 tops at the restaurant.

I tried contacting the driver but kept getting an error so I used the help chat function. DoorDash was able to contact my driver to find out he/she was having app issues so they sent a new driver to get my order and credited me $10. It was definitely frustrating but I really appreciated how it was handled.

I sent the food to the wrong address and was trying to input the correct address. There was no where to do that. There was also no where in the app to update the order or cancel the order.

For starters their drivers collect multiple orders and more often than not take upwards of 1.5 hours to deliver your food. By that time the food is stone cold, needing the assistance of a microwave to reheat. This is because many of the drivers collect multiple orders before delivering, while you wait hungry and your food turns into a block of ice. Door Dash doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for ruining your meal that you are paying for and does no refund the full amount of the food they destroyed. I‚Äôve worked as a chef in a restaurant or two and if this were to happen in a dining establishment (or with a driver) the meal would be comp‚Äôd hastily. The poor restaurant my wife and I ordered from felt so bad they sent us a redemption gift card for what Door Dash drivers did. Also this company claims to have affiliation with with restaurants they ‚Äúare connected with‚Äù when that isn‚Äôt the case and more often than not they are using outdated menus pilfered from outdated search engines.

They didn‚Äôt follow simple instructions and I got luke warm food at best. Don‚Äôt bother ordering if you have any special requests. I used to deliver for Postmates in the LA area and I know what it takes to be the delivery person. DoorDash my advice to you is maybe offer some kind of training program a web video or something that shows your driver how to properly take care of your customer. I can not use this service again.

Anyways, as I said, this app is amazing for delivering food. I used to have to order from the same couple of pizza shops in my area because all of the food places were further in town. However this app is crazy expensive. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous to have a service fee, a small order fee and then a crazy delivery fee. On top of that, I‚Äôve noticed there are a lot of miscommunications between orders and the person picking up/ delivering it/ the restaurant. When I put in all the details I expect it to be correct cause it‚Äôs all right there even in the receipt. It doesn‚Äôt make sense how orders come wrong. And they do  a decent amount of the time. 

Overall it‚Äôs not the best but it works. I can‚Äôt use it often because of how absurdly expensive it can be for even the smallest of orders but it‚Äôs very useful.",susan nefertiti,

So I called the resturant & they said the order has been ready for an hour & that the driver never arrived. I texted & called my driver, no answer until a little later, he finally picked up the order. The driver waited in the hotel parking lot just sitting there on his phone instead of coming to the door. I went out there, thanked him & he looked at me with a blank stare, saying nothing & rolled up the window. Then proceeded to sit in the lot for 20 mins afterwards (so strange). Customer service was extremely kind, they gave me $10 of door dash credit when my horrid experience costed $32, which i thought was a little unprofessional. I thought i‚Äôd give the app another chance today, since I have 10 credits. The delivery fee + service fee made me pay the same price that smoothie originally costed, EVEN WITH the $10 off.

The name of the driver was quite obvious a female, but an older male (maybe 50‚Äôs) is the one who showed up. I know this is true because my city is small, and Facebook is powerful that I was easily able to find who should have/really did deliver.

Other issues of course is after customization the order is still wrong. And seems to be consistent with a few particular restaurants.

Thats insane. especially if your not receiving your complete orders or if they are extremely late. i received an order from DD with two chicken sandwiches from daves hot chicken with one of the sandwiches had a bite taken out of the sandwich. you know what it looks like when a bite is taken from your sandwich. It was completely obvious. Door dash wouldnt refund. That is a health issue to receive food like that. i have received my food tampered from delivery drivers a few times. i complain when it doesn't come sealed from restraunt. anything could happen in between the time from the restraunt handing off your food to someone and you receiving it. i guess it will take people dying from some looney poisoning ppl before they actually take the proper measures to ensure safety to the consumers who already pay too much for these services.

After that I checked every few days but the same message was shown. However, even after 12 days I never recieved the refund and whenever I opened the missing item on the order it would say the same thing. I contacted customer support and they said they never recieved a refund request and it was passed the refund window. I told them I have a screenshot as proof and that I never recieved a notification of the request being unsuccessful. The rep said it was my fault for possibly closing the app early and not knowing about a confirmation message which I never recieved. Makes no sense because the app order history literally says they took care of issue on 11 Dec... even today... was scammed out of my refund by doordash.

You can expect to pay about 2-3x for your food when it is all said and done. First, they markup the menu items. Next, they charge delivery fees and other fees (which they just arbitrarily increase whenever they feel like it). Also, they compute the suggested tip prices based on the total instead of subtotal, so you‚Äôre tipping on the fees and tax (which is DoorDash trying to increase driver wages without ponying up the cash themselves). The nickel and dime crap is getting very old.

On top of the fact that we are paying twice or thrice what the restaurant charges and over-tipping, the service is usually not good. Dashers don‚Äôt check receipts, so orders are often incomplete or just entirely wrong. The food is also usually cold.

Overall, it is just disappointing. There is so much potential for delivery services, but the overcharging and lackluster service ruins the experience. I‚Äôd rather just save myself the frustration and pick up my own meals. I‚Äôll probably just stop using this app out of principal.",JMG Design Lab,

My only other complaint is that my food needs to be checked before it leaves the store because I did not wait 2 hours for you guys to find a driver just for all my food not to be there anyway at that point I should‚Äôve just walked to go get my food because it‚Äôs inconvenient and upsetting im pregnant yall are stressing me out,sufartitttsss,

This just happened to me today and to top it off the driver did not let me know my food had even been delivered. So naturally I got cold food again. Now why should I tip a driver for a poor performance. They are basically stealing money at this point. I have no problem tipping generously but if they get tipped before doing the job then why should they care if they get the right door. You need to change it. When you get your notification of food delivered then you put in your tip.  They will make sure you get your food then and everyone‚Äôs happy.

My daughter is allergic to gluten and must emphasize to the restaurant that items must be gluten free. I can find no place to notify the restaurant of allergies or to just convey additional info like extra butter, etc. The app also does not give you the address of the restaurant where the order is being filled. Not a problem with unique Mom & Pop places, but problematical when the restaurant is a chain like Red Lobster. I placed an order to Red Lobster through the app and their omission of part of the order caused one person not to have a meal. The app only allowed me a credit to my DoorDash account, not a refund to my credit card. This assumes that I will use the app again, and I have still paid for an item I did not receive. It did not let me know which one of the three Red Lobster restaurants near me filled the order so I could be sure not to patronize them again. The other delivery service apps are better.",Reeves9554,

The real time updates on your delivery is pretty neat, even though it‚Äôs taken up to two hours for something right around the corner to be delivered (I think it has to do with drivers that are super far away claiming an order before someone close by has a chance to do so). Not only are waiting times for your food insane, but the UPCHARGE on items that are meant to be cheap is ludicrous! Something off of the dollar menu (usually $1 flat) was listed at $1.34... now that may not mean anything to most of you, but paying a whole 34% more on a food item meant to be cheap is unbelievable. To put things into perspective, if your order is $30, expect to pay $40 plus taxes, the delivery fee, and tip ($30 just turned into $50). Yeah, you don‚Äôt have to drive out to the restaurant and get your food delivered right to your door, but having over a third of your regular total added on to your bill is a definite no no to me.

However, there was a huge change recently and we have one foot out the door when it comes to using this app. A few dashers have struggled to locate our address- when we have specify the name of our community and with some, spoke on the phone. What we are tired of is getting a message ‚Äúyour dasher is completing another order on the way to you‚Äù. Sometimes that means a few minutes late, which we understand since everyone needs to maximize their work schedule, but 45 or more minutes wait on the order and receiving cold food on arrival? That‚Äôs a bit too much. The practice is not a good customer service. If not possible or willing to deliver on time, why take the order in the first place?

Then, proceeded to kick me off of 2 chats rudely and then the 3rd chat a supervisor said he will escalate it. He said they will try to refund you with extra compensation.

I had one night where the agents allowed me to just re-order my food because they got it wrong. They got it wrong two more times and then closed.

I uninstalled the app about 6 months ago after a terrible driver experience and customer service experience where they dropped my food off at the wrong address and then refused to correct it or refund me so i had to go a mile away to collect my cold food from the office. But today took the cake. I ordered some food for delivery through the wawa app which apparently is serviced by doordash. It took my driver 50 minutes to get from the restaurant to my door despite the driver being at the restaurant the entire time. Took almost one full hour when i literally live across the street from wawa. I could‚Äôve crawled there on my hands and knees to and from faster than it took my driver to get here.

This is the third time in a row that I've had a dasher do multiple other deliveries before I get my food and it definitely affects the quality of the food. It's not worth it to order food to be delivered if it's cold/Luke warm and soggy when it arrives. I was hoping this time would be different, but I don't see a need to order from DoorDash anymore since this continues to happen.

When I signed up for DashPass about 9 months ago there were maybe 10 options, including several in neighboring towns (which are each maybe a 10 minute drive on the highway).  That was a pretty good rotation and I typically would order 2 or more times per week.  However, as of 3 weeks ago, all of the options from the next town are now deemed too far away!  Now, unless I want to order fast food, I just have three options: Applebee‚Äôs, a local bar and grill, and a sushi restaurant.

In the chat area they just read past somethings. Since adding in a second address (my job) I have mistakenly put the wrong address in twice. Even though I had figured out how to change it to the other address after contacting the chat, I figured it might be prudent to stay on the line and make the suggestion about a prompt to double check the address the food is heading to.

Then he opened his trunk, and the third pizza was inside. He said he had made a mistake and had multiple orders, but mine was the only pizza box in his truck.   

The driver had clearly driven just close enough to my house to be able to select delivered in the app, and planned to drive away with my food.

It said the food was ready around 8:45, so by the time it got to me it was cold. The driver just said, ‚Äúit was busy.‚Äù The driver that I tipped twice the suggested tip in advance because the tip is in advance. It‚Äôs frustrating to watch the gps drive two towns in the wrong direction when they‚Äôre already a half hour late.

I used this app a lot, but it‚Äôs too expensive for this. Over two hours, and it‚Äôs not the first time. If it said two hours, I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered, but it said 30 minutes. If they‚Äôre understaffed I can understand, but then give accurate times so I know not to order. 

Also, the prices of the items are cheaper if you order directly from the restaurant. I once saved $20 by ordering directly from a pizza place rather than the app. Probably time to start cooking at home more anyway.",CindyGirl419,

Well, at 12:15 I received a call saying the original driver canceled so they were sending another one and she was on her way and would be at my office shortly. I checked the app and they had a 76 minutes left on the ETA. I contacted support who then tried to get me to accept DoorDash credit for my order. Why would I want credit for DoorDash when they are clearly incapable of doing thing right? They then told me that since I canceled my order I‚Äôd have my money back in 5-7 days and blamed it on my bank. Anytime I‚Äôve done a refund or return I received the money within 3 days; my bank is clearly not the problem. So, I ordered from UberEats which delivered within 25 minutes. They were TEN MINUTES EARLY. And DoorDash can‚Äôt even be on time. Matter of fact, DoorDash was going to be at least an hour and a half late. Never again.

A lot of them are not the fault of DoorDash, and they handle these other problems very well. For example, if items are missing or you don‚Äôt receive your item at all, you are immediately awarded DoorDash credit.

On the off chance, however, that it is at the fault of the app, it is a little harder to talk with support in regards to it. I ordered from chick-fil-a and the order went through. I received my food 30 minutes following and everything was perfect‚Äî except there was another knock at my door, followed by another chick-fil-a order. It turns out that their app had glitched and ordered twice, charging me again for the second order.

I pay the monthly dash pass as well as only order when I have extra money to leave a generous tip because I understand it‚Äôs a struggle these days and yet all I‚Äôm met with is cold food. They allow drivers to stock pile orders and then by the time yours arrives it‚Äôs ice cold food, melted drinks, and a very unhappy costumer. I don‚Äôt know who thought it a good idea to allow stock piled orders for a food delivery service but whoever did is an idiot. This happens to us way too often and I‚Äôm fed up.

Also, with their delivery drivers, you do not know if your order will be right, your food will be warm, or if the delivery driver will deliver your food at all, or if your delivery driver will listen to instructions, read your text, or speak English. Had plenty of times where I text their drivers for something extra, like ketchup from McDonald‚Äôs, and they don‚Äôt deliver. I ordered a horchata with tacos from Rili B‚Äôs and the driver did not text me that they did not have horchata at all. Just delivered the food and left it.

I waited and saw no refund. When I called DoorDash customer service, I was told that I didn‚Äôt contact them within 3 days of not receiving my refund, so they were no longer obligated to refund my money (per their policy that they couldn‚Äôt present to me). The second time, I placed an order ‚Äî unaware it would be through DoorDash as I placed it through a restaurant‚Äôs website ‚Äî and after waiting an hour, I was again informed that the order could not be completed and the dasher simply gave up and said I would have to wait while the order got assigned to a new dasher.

The food usually arrives on time and is still hot, but this only happens if you‚Äôre ordering from a place close by. You can‚Äôt expect to order from clear across town and get it hot, so check expected time before ordering. My biggest beef is that the restaurants charge more for food items than what is charged normally and I don‚Äôt get why. It‚Äôs just a normal to go order. Some places charge more for delivery too, so it‚Äôs not like they aren‚Äôt making money. Just be careful and watch the fees, otherwise you pay $15 bucks for three tacos which would only cost you $8 if you went through the drive thru. I guess that‚Äôs the price you pay for convenience.

When I tried getting help on the DoorDash app, I was offered a credit on future orders, only for the one missing item.  While they waived delivery fee, there was a service fee charged for about $3, and the prices were higher than menu prices, so they grossly overcharged and still provided poor service.  Example, the salad they missed is $8.29 when ordered directly from Portillo‚Äôs, but $9.95 on DoorDash, plus service fee on top of the increased price.  This was the first time I have ordered on the app, and given this disaster, I do not intend to order again.  I have sent them an email demanding a refund instead.  I tried their chat, but was left waiting for 20 minutes, despite their site saying 2 minutes estimate.  I would call, but DoorDash does not offer a phone number for customers when you click help.

I try to contact customer service to ask what happened, but the only option to do so goes through the oder page, but when they cancelled my order, it removed it from the order page so there was no way to do so. I couldn‚Äôt find anything to message and call for customer service. Then it was too late to reorder the food from that restaurant. 

Biggest issue with this was it seemed there was no way to contact customer service to see what was done with my order.

Otherwise you are stuck calling the place you ordered, explaining all of this and waiting for your order to be received before they can do anything about it. Or u can leave a note in the driver comments, which will only cause delay because they will need to get the order remade before leaving to store to come to you.

However the app is very tricky. Sometimes the menus are somewhat different from the actual menu from the restaurant. Also, I wish the ordering system was more easier. I just tried ordering a bagel sandwich from a breakfast spot and picking items are contradicting. For example, I ordered a mushroom, spinach, egg sandwich & there are two categories to choose from: one is extras (optional) and the other is required choices. In the extras category, they had options of asiago bagel, cheese gourmet bagel, jalape√±o bagel, etc. In the required section they also have bagel options such jalape√±o, everything, plain, etc. I wanted an asiago bagel with my sandwich so of course I picked that but it wasn‚Äôt one of the options in the required section.

The Restaurants that I‚Äôve ordered from mostly either don‚Äôt make an item to the correct way or just forget the item in general.

Personally I have nothing against DoorDash, my problem is with the restaurants just doing literally what they feel like doing that day.

I recently wrote 2 reviews (one positive, one negative); neither got posted, and it wasn‚Äôt because I said anything defamatory or untrue. It seems as though DoorDash is more worried about potentially offending a restaurant partner than providing accurate ratings and honest feedback for its customers.

To me, this is somewhat of a deal breaker. I‚Äôm eager to try new restaurants, but I want to have some sense of what people are saying about the place before I order from them.

I told the rep the food was already on its way, she had to confirm again indicating that she didn‚Äôt have record of the food being picked up.  Then instead of identifying and telling me how they would fix this problem, this was not the first time this happened, I wanted to know what the disconnect was. They offered me a $5 credit, I don‚Äôt care about the money.  I wanted to know if it was a restaurant issue or something else so that I can plan accordingly in the future. Offering credits might work for some but I contacted support for an explanation not a $5 credit in a $50 order.",cwgfrustrated,

When we called to see if they were having trouble finding us, they said the road was blocked off and they weren‚Äôt sure where to go. After giving them alternate directions, we waited a bit longer for them to arrive, and they never did. All subsequent calls to check on the dasher were deliberately ignored. After waiting an hour-and-a-half for food we never received, we reached out to DoorDash support to either find out where our food was or to get a refund. We were told that the issue would be investigated, and we‚Äôd get an email follow up. The email they sent us told us that they couldn‚Äôt give us a refund because the dasher attempted to deliver our food despite us saying numerous times that they never showed up.

In short, DoorDash took our money, didn‚Äôt even attempt to deliver our order, and refused to give us our money back. You‚Äôd be just as well off giving your cash to random strangers on the street and asking them to go grab you some food. In a way that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd be doing with DoorDash.",shadowAKA086,
768,Not again...,False,2019-06-02 01:20:25,1,"Well, it looks like I‚Äôll just have to start picking up my own food again. I loved the convenience of Uber Eats and used them several times. Until they started adding a service fee. One that cost as much as feeding an extra person. So I switched to Door Dash and had great choices and no extra fees. Until today. I have a sick child at home and couldn‚Äôt leave, she wouldn‚Äôt let me get away from her long enough to cook. Cuddles were all she wanted. Yet I had myself and two other mouths to feed. So I figured we could get something good delivered. We decided what we wanted and went through the menu and finally had an order ready. I went to pay and noticed the total was quite a bit higher than I thought it should have been. So aside from the $5.99 delivery fee (which is the highest I‚Äôve seen), there was also a service fee for over $8. Again, I could‚Äôve fed another person for that. I still had to tip. So between tip, service fee, and delivery fee, I spent more money for those than I did for any person in my house eating. 
My only solution is to just pick up things myself and save at least $10, give or take.

The time never changed and we didn‚Äôt even get something to let us know why it was taking forever.  By the time it showed that the driver was in front of our house he completed the order but never walked up to the door.  We couldn‚Äôt contact him to ask if he needed help to find our home because he completed the order, and we waited about 20 minutes after he completed the order on the app to see if he could find us.  We ended up queueing to text an agent (which took about 20 minutes) who ended up asking us to go knocking door to door to see if someone else had our food.  Eventually the agent said they emailed their supervisor and that we would receive an email from them today to see about getting a refund but nothing has come.

The drivers can accept as many orders as they want (& they will, more money for them) they then have to deliver them in the order that DD tells them to. A restaurant 10 minutes away from your house easily takes over an hour as you watch your dasher drive back and forth across the city with the food you paid for- while they go to 4 other restaurants before brining yours. *even if they pass your house in the process. You can only add a tip (unless cash) right when you place the order. Even if they don‚Äôt show the drivers until the end, service like this shouldn‚Äôt get a tip. Then you‚Äôre just screwed. UberEats has very low if any fees 90% of the time, and they are VERY punctual. Before I knew about them, I only used DD. Never realized how terrible it really was until I saw the same thing done right.

Never ever get utensils. Fees are atrocious- by the time you add up a delivery fee, service fee (still don‚Äôt understand the explanation of what this is), and tip you are looking at a 40% markup.

Then, after the order is confirmed a whole other ETA is given. That‚Äôs untruthful. In addition, lately I have had more driver reassignments and additional drop offs that cause my ETA to be even longer than re-estimated. This is unacceptable. If I am paying fees and a tip I do not agree that you should make any changes to my order after it is placed, period. Today my order was cancelled by your app because the driver(s) apparently, (even though they were at the restaurant on the app) did not make it to the restaurant before breakfast was over - YOUR APP SAYS YOU CAN ORDER UNTIL 10:29 IT WAS 10:24 when I received the confirmation email.

Ok, then there‚Äôs the rest of it.
1. Can‚Äôt pay dash pass with Apple Pay even though you can pay for services with Apple Pay. Really?
2. If you want to order from multiple places, you have to place multiple orders. Seriously? Ya can‚Äôt write anything on the backend to send info where it needs to go? That‚Äôs pretty basic data stuff.
3. As others have pointed out, setting up the tip before the order is even sent to the store or restaurant is pretty darned silly. I get that this might make things more attractive for dashers, but wow. I have no clue how good the service is going to be.
4. If any single item is no longer available, you can‚Äôt reorder anything easily. Meaning if there‚Äôs an order with ten things on it, and one isn‚Äôt available right now, you gotta recreate the whole thing. Again, pretty simple data stuff on the backend. 
5. Yay, I can rate the dashers and stores. But I can‚Äôt see what my dasher has been rated?
6. How do I leave a tip for the provider, not just the dasher? I leave a tip on a big order, which goes to the driver who did ten minutes work.

I‚Äôm also insanely sick of tipping people high amounts just to get food that is ice cold because they chose to make four stops on the way for other people. I literally had somebody pick up my food and stop three different orders on the way to my house when my place I ordered from was only eight minutes away‚Ä¶ It took an hour and a half to get my food. Another thing that is super annoying is when the Dasher doesn‚Äôt ask or let you know when they are out of an item.

The last straw was with a Wendy‚Äôs order which I placed at 9am and took until 10:45 when the driver told me breakfast had stopped and this my order had to be canceled.

As such I deleted my account and warn you all who read this that doordash is just a delivery service that doesn‚Äôt care as long as they can add ‚Äúservice fees‚Äù and make your $15 order almost $30 with delivery fees and auto filling a tip which cannot be undone once you place the order and realize your mistake",Machaelis,

I‚Äôve only had an issue once where they didn‚Äôt deliver. It was due to technical difficulties at the one restaurant but they got me taken care of with my money as credits so I can order elsewhere immediately. I work as a call center supervisor so great service and accountability goes a long way with me. 

ONLY SUGGESTION: make it so I can tip afterwards. I don‚Äôt trust tipping before hand because the one time I didn‚Äôt get my food, the dasher didn‚Äôt even have the decency to contact me and advise me to cancel the order, and he just got the tip I guess.

If you don‚Äôt tip well enough, you‚Äôre food will take forever to arrive. If you tip well, it may still take forever to arrive. DoorDash often schedules multiple deliveries for the same driver in the same run. By the time your food arrives, it‚Äôs cold and it‚Äôs not even the driver‚Äôs fault. DoorDash offers a Dash Pass which helps cuts out the honest amount they skim off the top. They still jack up the price you pay and you have to pay a monthly fee for this but it does help. Another good thing they have going is the number of restaurants they have available.

I would rate five stars if DoorDash would get rid of price markups, stop double booking driver deliveries, and allow me to tip based on service quality provided. If that means a more fee then at least it‚Äôs straightforward.",cg8908,

When they arrived with half the food we told them you left half at the restaurant, then we were faced with the first half getting cold while they went back for the half they forgot and it would be cold by the time they picked it up and delivered it. Not good. They need to check that they got all the food ordered.
2. You can only leave the Dasher a tip when ordering! This is TERRIBLE! You need to be able to add the tip once you experience the service.

When we had the issue and had to call Door Dash to tell them we didn‚Äôt get our food, initially they wanted to just credit us the amount of the food they forgot.

As someone who has worked restaurants where door dash will send you an order 5min before close, its frustrating for the kitchen staff, the driver, and for the customer who is probably  unknowing, since door dash doesn't show closing times blatantly. But especially when things end up being too late and the order has to be cancelled. And to make matters worse, Door dash doesn't always recognize or receive these cancellations. And will still send a driver there and leave the customer expecting an order that will never come.  Wasting everyones time. They do well to compensate for these mishaps.

I patiently wait and check on my order and the text notifications and app updates were completely different. I would receive a text saying my order was on the way, and then the app would say it hasn‚Äôt been picked up yet. So I wait for 2 hours... 2 hours, I go outside and stand outside for 15 min and there is no driver in sight. Then my app tells me it‚Äôs been delivered snd to enjoy! Thoroughly irritated at this point, i call customer service where Danika took my case, after i waited 20 min. She tells me the driver couldn‚Äôt be reached and i told her i wanted a refund, per my dispute. She tried to sell me on getting s credit on my account to use later. Thoroughly upset, i say absolutely not I want the full amount to be refunded to my card.

820,The Only Good Food Delivery App Left,False,2021-02-03 18:05:29,5,"So while Grubhub is having an identity crisis, UberEats is killing off its customer base with its signature UberStyle customer service, and Postmates falling apart as we speak, DoorDash is the only app that‚Äôs remained consistent in terms of 1.) Fees 2.) Pricing 3.) Customer Service, and of course 4.) App Usability. 

With the start of COVID-19, Postmates and UberEats nearly doubled their service fees since Denver asked for those fees to be lowered for accessibility purposes. DoorDash, however, remained consistent and even offers free delivery from more restaurants than the above combined (did I mention- this is without DashPass?).

DoorDash is not only the last affordable food delivery app, with its app specific specials and prices, but the only one whose outsourced customer service is at least prompt and efficient.

The reason why I‚Äôve left a 4 star review and not a 5 star? Payment verification is a bit rough.

There‚Äôs a glitch that requires you to scan your card for verification. If you happen to get to this screen, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to add your card to the app, and most likely, you will have to default to ApplePay. This not only has happened to me, but my friends as well. Since they don‚Äôt have the ease of ApplePay, they just avoid the app altogether, unfortunately. Hoping DoorDash will fix this soon as this issue occurred well before the pandemic.",talonlikesboba,

Also once the cart is empty the app automatically closes which is a bit annoying if I change my mind about what I want and have to take things out of the cart. Certain restaurant options have outdated inventory listings so when I order from things like convenience stores and such I often get calls from the driver saying what they do and don't have, possibly an issue to work out with the merchant themselves.

So I contacted doordash I was not looking for a refund just simply to have someone bring me the correct order because this was our dinner and I had 3 kids starving.

Small orders (>$10) and orders with little to no tip 
(0-8%) most often make their way to the back of the line, to most likely get picked up by an inexperienced delivery driver. I experienced this on many occasions before I actually became a delivery driver myself, the food almost never arrived on time and was often missing items like drinks and extra goods. After joining, I then understood why I had always been disappointed with DoorDash‚Äôs services.

Then the driver Miguel called and said he was outside my house and hung right up. I opened the door and nobody was there, walked out to the curb, nobody. I had already been charged and the transaction marked as complete by the driver so I waited to chat with an agent who gave me the option of full refund or redelivery. I said redelivery and take the tip from the first guy and credit it to the 2nd driver. They sent another driver and charged me again for the tip. I waited to chat again to ask for a refund of that second charge but I still have not received that. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so fast to take my money but so hard and so long to get it back.

Called DoorDash, and was told that they only charged me once, and that I had to take it up with the restaurant. Called the restaurant, and spoke to the manager. Explained what had transpired, and she told me that DoorDash called them, and told them to process the order as a phone order. This meant to the restaurant, that they needed to charge the customer (Me). I had to call DoorDash back, and spent another 30 minutes going back and forth. They finally gave me a refund. However,I should not have been charged at all for what happened, as my food was cold, and quite honestly, who would want to eat anything after all the headache?

I got a call two hours later saying that the restaurant has to cancel my order. At this time it was too late to order anything else so I figured I use the credit they gave me as an apology and try again the next day. I was unable to process my order and got errors that my card was invalid even though it was the exact same card stored on my account that I had used before. I contacted my bank and they assured me there was no transaction coming through so the decline had to be from an app error, which it was. I called customer support and submit an online case and was just drug around in pointless circles. Finally I was able to get my card issue resolved and was only met by another ambiguous issue that took up two more days of my time emailing support back and forth to no avail.

It spent an additional 10 minutes trying to get 4-5 people to accept the delivery before it was finally accepted by someone in a town 20 minutes away. The driver barely made it to the restaurant before it closed. Our food was luke warm because it sat for an additional 30minutes waiting for a driver to pick it up. I will not be using this service again, next time I‚Äôll call in my order and get off my bum and get it myself. If the driver is potentially coming from a different town, the service needs to find a driver BEFORE the food is finished. 
Also, beware, I had a promo that said I wasn‚Äôt paying the delivery fee. The promo showed up the entire time I was placing my order and through out the process of checking out.

I have only ordered twice so far within the 30 days of still having the discount/coupon. But I‚Äôm sure I will still be using the service even after my discount has expired. It seems to be great so far. I don‚Äôt have a vehicle so being able to get foods sent to my door that I normally wouldn‚Äôt be able to easily get on my own is just awesome period.

The pricing was off- this is a place where you order customizable bowls, salads, etc. if I ordered one of the pre-chosen ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù then the price was more fair (marked up by just a few dollars from the in-store price) but if I tried to do an order where I chose my toppings, as soon as a chose my protein (which comes with the bowl, it‚Äôs standard) the price went up to $23. This bowl costs $8.50 in the store.

 Anyway, I made my order (I choose from the more fairly marked items$ and went to pick it up and when I got there the restaurant didn‚Äôt even have record of my order. I showed them in the app where it said I had ordered and that my order was ready! 

 I sent my feedback to doordash, where they sent me a standard ‚Äúthanks for the feedback, we will make sure it gets to the right place‚Äù email and then a couple days later they sent an email asking if they ‚Äúresolved the issue‚Äù.

I understand not wanting to open up the food though. There‚Äôs no way to tell the driver after they‚Äôve left if your food is wrong. You just have to report it to the app and they (typically) refund you some portion - which is fine - but I wanted my food. So I either pay the delivery fee AGAIN to try to get the food I didn‚Äôt get, I go out and get it myself (which kinda defeats the purpose), or I go without that food. I also don‚Äôt like that I have to tip before I‚Äôve gotten my order. UberEats lets you tip after you‚Äôve gotten your food and confirmed everything is correct.

My friend had people somehow access his account and card info to order expensive items he never had anything to do with and never ordered. When he called the delivery driver to tell him he did not order that and to not come the driver said don‚Äôt worry the company will refund him and decided to show up anyway in an extremely bizarre and shady move.

My region of the world gets crazy bad weather, so sometimes DoorDash can feel like a literal lifesaver. 

All that being said, it does have its downsides. As a company that operates remotely and utilized local workers, it relies heavily on the honors system with its employees. A lot of people will be simultaneously working three or more jobs at once while being on a run for DoorDash. Ya can‚Äôt blame them, but it can severely alter your delivery timeline if they take another order or job while handling your order. 

99.9% of DoorDash drivers are awesome people that hustle more than delivery drivers working at restaurants. Sometimes though, there can be weird experiences with drivers and there isn‚Äôt really anyone to call and report the issue directly to. At least not easily. 

Leaving a review can feel intimidating if you had a specifically odd experience since the drivers are able to see your rating right away.

Or have an actual need for food delivery. Shame on them for taking advantage of those that are vulnerable.

Or the original dasher couldn‚Äôt notify me earlier instead of just ‚Äòdashing‚Äô on the order? You guys need to step it up and maybe take a look at how UberEats operates as I will be taking my business there. At least with them the restaurant has to accept the order on their end to proceed.

So many local restaurants have lackluster online ordering and when I call I feel like I‚Äôm burdening staff who are busy helping in-person customers ‚Äî not to mention, when I order over the phone, the order is seldom accurate as the order-taker is often distracted.

Some new features include the ability to send meals to other people as gifts. This is great for sending dinner to my elderly parents during Covid. Although I haven‚Äôt yet figured out how to search for restaurants near an address other than my own. 

The delivery drivers are really good. The app lets you watch them approach on a map. You can easily leave special instructions regarding drop-off, and can do a totally contactless delivery that keeps you and the driver safer.

Then I get an email from the rep saying ‚Äú just checking to see if you have solved your issue, our chat closed..blah, blah, blah. Same thing every. Time. I am researching different delivery services that have correct information on restaurants hours, apps that don‚Äôt say that a restaurant is out of the delivery area one day, and okay to get delivery from the other and correct menus. And most importantly a customer service that is willing to help if needed. When I do, door dash is losing a customer.

One thing I would add is putting in the option to tip the drivers more after the drop-off. I feel like if they arrived with your food unharmed, uneaten, and still sealed they deserve a little extra. I once tipped an uber $20 after talking about beautiful foreign foods, and I figured it would be my pleasure to pay for her lunch. After an uber ride you can‚Äôt call, or send a text to thank your rider/driver, so she just thanked me for the tip.
I feel the same should apply to doordash since we‚Äôre trusting a stranger with our food, and if it arrives safely they should have the chance at an extra-extra tip. Bless.",FoodIsTheRoot,

It just says you need to enter a payment method. 
My lower rate is because the support was awful trying to troubleshoot and fix the issue. All they did was send a list of general steps to take (common sense stuff like updating, quitting and deleting, re-downloading, sign out and sign back in, etc... Did all that before they sent the list. Told them that, and even replied with pics showing the error. The response I got was they were forwarding to a technical team to review and assist further.

Obviously, just like all delivery services, you have to pay the delivery fee and are recommended to pay a tip which is fine. Of course you can get around the delivery fee if you subscribe to the Dash Pass which is definitely worth it if you order take out often. But for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt eat out often, paying for the Dash Pass or evening using the service is not worth the potential doubling of the price of my meal just because it‚Äôs delivered.

I let doordash know that my food had not been delivered in over 2hrs and that they need to contact their delivery person so my food could be delivered and yet nothing. They kept telling me there was nothing they can do. Never giving an actual solution to my problem. I had ordered a large meal for myself and friends who were starving but we couldn‚Äôt get it. Doordash is an app that lets people steal your meal and doesn‚Äôt reimburse you for it or find a solution for you. Don‚Äôt bother using it because it‚Äôs trash.,It's decent I guess,

Nothing from him. I keep checking the status of my order and now it says no delivery option available at this time. I called the restaurant to see if any door dash driver picked up my food and they said no, it‚Äôs still waiting. I picked it up myself and it was of cold at that time since it had been waiting for quite some time.

I wait 20 minutes before I end up having to call door dash, only for them to call me right then. The lady was nice but it had been an hour before they contacted me. They gave me door dash credit and cancelled the order (which is now useless since I'll never use this app again).

I am not quitting using door dash because of that terrible experience, I am quitting because the app did not even work properly after. The lady told me not to order from the same place so I switch to Chipotle. I try to place an order and this time did not tip (the last order I tipped and it took it without me even getting food) but an error keeps popping up online and through the app. When I set the tip to 3$, MAGICALLY door dash wants to work and successfully processed the payment...

Great nineteen credits on a forty-eight dollar order. Now I can get back a forth of what I paid for. The market is already hard enough with out companies like this masquerading as convenient no hassle solutions when they just add more problems.

953,Dasher stole my credit card info,False,2019-03-08 06:14:06,5,"Okay so I have used Door Dash a few times with no issues. That all changed today. I place an order this evening and got a phone call from someone at customer service saying my card could not process through and they needed my card number to try it again.  In hindsight, I should have been more aware and cautious about giving this guy my card info, but he sounded legit so I gave it to him and I really believed he was from Customer Service. 

Turns out this man was not from Customer service, but was in fact the Dasher who was supposed to be delivering my order and he had tried to rack up charges on my card (over $1000). Luckily, my bank recognized it as fraud and no charge went through, but this was a huge inconvenience, as i had to cancel my card. I obviously never received my food, either. 

I then reported it to the actual customer service and they acted as if they really just didn‚Äôt care and they had a hard time grasping what I was trying to tell them. I asked to speak to a supervisor to no avail and was getting the run around. They actually hung up on me twice as well. Will be filing a complaint and doing whatever possible to get this guy caught.

Door Dash orders arrive timely, they inform us of any issues right away, and the ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù are uniformly friendly and courteous. Their promo codes are frequent and generous, customer service via chat is spot-on, and Dash Pass at $10 a month not only provides free deliveries for orders over $12, but also a significant discount on service fees.

Please forgive any typos or errors. Simply put, doordash is a great service, and it‚Äôs super convenient. Almost every option you could want is available. UI is excellent. However, I rarely use it, because the prices always seem to add up to so much more than I expected, even on low delivery fee orders. You pay for the convenience. It also takes about an hour or so from order time to food in hand. Which is fair... maybe faster is unreasonable to ask for. But between that and the extra cost, it usually makes more sense for me to just go pick up food myself, or eat out. 

Anyway, rambling a bit - in summary, great to have as an option, and the only issues are mostly associated with the nature of food delivery, not doordash as a business.",kernal popcorn,

This makes the delivery double the amount of time to get to us, cold cold cold food and seems to make it harder on the dash driver. I understand times are different due to COVID but I miss it when the dasher took 10-20 minutes to get to us and our food was still warm. AND as I‚Äôm waiting for my current order, I can see my dasher has been sitting outside of Chili‚Äôs for 20 minutes when my food is from a different restaurant 10 minutes away from Chili‚Äôs.

It‚Äôs a piece of crap and I gave the driver the majority of the credits in tips instead of buying more food because it‚Äôs not fair to them either to miss out on some monies.

On top. No customer service tab under account or anywhere.

Instead of refunding using credits for shoddy orders, don‚Äôt charge the card immediately. Charge the card after a 15 minute grace period to allow for post-voiding, as every other app and business does due to server coms with banks. Fix the programming within the app so address changes STAY EDITED and allow for orders that use credits-only without forcing to add payment and spend more It‚Äôs not a safe nor customer-friendly business practice.

It would give me a pop up saying because of my account history, they would no longer take my claims. Seriously? It‚Äôs not my fault the food is wrong or items are missing.

One thing I'd like to note is to please be mindful of any time you happen to have a problem with your order.  As a former restaurant employee myself, I can attest that delivery drivers do exist in these services that will make awful errors in their deliveries sometimes, and there's nothing more frustrating for the restaurant than to get a call from an angry customer over a problem that arose with the delivery driver.  Sometimes it is the stores fault but please don't jump to conclusions on who messed up because it might have been an incompetent driver.

When that didn‚Äôt happen I reached out to my driver who informed me she had to drop off two other orders prior to mine and would arrive soon. Okay, sure, understandable. But why would your app even have a driver take on that many orders at rush hour in the first place? So then I wait another 20 minutes when I finally get a second notification telling me that NOW my driver is on the way. Then the GPS shows the car moving.

I asked why he needed that since I put all the info in the app. He kept repeating he needed it so I sent it to him. The restaurant I ordered from was two miles down the road and it took him over 40 minutes to get here. I finally called him and he said he lost my number.

One would think if you are offering a service to deliver food by a given time you might confirm the order went through prior to the customer inquiring at the time it was SUPPOSED to be delivered. The whole purpose of ordering ahead is to ensure your meal is delivered at a desired time, such as your break time. I realize the restaurant may be having issues, but due diligence would dictate that you let your customer know at the time the order is presented. If I go to a restaurant sit down and order a steak, they will tell me when I order that they are out of steak.

I had the same BS come up with Door Dash asking for ratings on food that was never delivered.

Long story short, I had to do that 3 times before I finally got someone to help. In the end, we never got our food. I got in my car and ended up picking something up at 10PM.

On iOS, the app has no options to leave a note for the restaurant, like making modifications or asking for sauces and silverware, etc. There is a box to leave these notes, but it always says that the restaurant is unable to fulfill special requests, even when the restaurant is not aware that this option has been disabled. 

Some unnecessary ordering options are ‚Äúrequired,‚Äù as well, leading to a very chunky Ordering experience and opening up room for potential misfires. 

And I‚Äôm not sure the delivery instructions show up for the driver. We always ask them to not knock on the door but it never seems to keep the drivers from doing it. 

There are so many more problems that I‚Äôm going to skip to the end here. 

I‚Äôve had problems with individual restaurants and drivers but my main frustrations are with the app itself. Unfortunately, this is the only app that has any options or drivers in my small 100k person town, so Grubhub and Uber Eats (both of which work much more smoothly with far fewer bugs) aren‚Äôt an option. 

I hope the app gets a major overhaul to fix the many bugs. I enjoy the service overall, outside of a few nasty encounters with their support team, and would like to see it improved for iOS.",ahshtbhwbs bhde,

Apparently, the order goes through Doordash and if they don‚Äôt call it in you end up waiting extra time - in his case until not only was that restaurant closed, but everything else in the area as well. Then the driver had no idea how to refund my card, so I sat on hold for another 30 minutes with the corporate office whose big apology was offering a credit or refund for food I never got. After complaining, I was given both. Don‚Äôt fall for a flashy app. They have no idea what they are doing.

I have given this app 2 more tries. My second attempt ended in another $20 credit because the order took 90 minutes after being quoted 20-30. The last attempt was the same issue - only this time it was cold chicken that had been waiting for 40 minutes at the restaurant to be picked up.

Most of the time you have to wait in long lines in restaurants or wait for restaurants to even have the order ready, (let‚Äôs be honest the food is never ready; resulting in a 15-30 minute wait). By then the customer is ticked off, you‚Äôve gone beyond the hour and you‚Äôve used your time for one order. Not to mention each order is usually a drive way beyond the imaginable distance for the delivery. As a result I end up spending more on gas then I do earning. Profiting a mere $20 bucks at most. By the end of the delivery the customer usually isn‚Äôt happy for having to wait so long and even if you do happen to make it on time with no mistakes or anything you don‚Äôt get tipped doordash customers apparently don‚Äôt believe in tipping.

However, most of the time it happens, the driver is awesome and goes back and gets the issue fixed. Whether it was at the wrong house or just the wrong item/order, whatever. I wish in those instances, I could go back and raise my tip at least. They definitely deserve that much.

The fees are getting out of hand (not anything to do with tip) and the prices compared to just picking it up myself are ridiculous. I get that this is a service for convenience, but it‚Äôs just too much. I would rather pay for my own gas, and gas prices are already very high on their own. 

If that isn‚Äôt the worst part, it feels like I do a coin flip if I get my food or not. I‚Äôve cycled through four drivers before and had to cancel after an hour of waiting. Thankfully support made up for it by giving credit back, but that just meant I had to order through DD again later. There‚Äôs been multiple instances of food disappearing or taking over an hour (from 35-45 minute estimations if I order early before dinner/lunch rushes) from a place just ten minutes up the road. Even just last week a whole bag of food was missing and I only received half the order. 

For every mistake, scale of over an hour, or vanishing act from a Dasher- it‚Äôs just too many let downs.

First of all, why was this not updated on the menu? It should have shown me that this item was unavailable. I understand that this is partially the restaurant‚Äôs fault. Something isn‚Äôt syncing up between them and DoorDash. BUT DoorDash should have an option to select a different meal from the same restaurant if that happens. That would be great. Instead, I had to make a new order for the same restaurant which turned out to be more money in the end because of all the fees. I also find it funny that they are so quick to take your money but it takes 5-7 days to return it. Guess I will be using Uber Eats instead.

The people that have delivered our food have all been outstanding and very polite, etc.  The only issue I have is that DoorDash has an up charge on all the meals ordered on their website.  I thought with the dash pass and already paying for delivery, we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay extra, but if you compare the business website with ordering on the door dash website, you do pay about 1-2 dollars over on meals.  We have continued to use them but may have to reconsider the dash pass charge since it is on top of the already up-charged menu items. It may be better to go without the dash pass and order directly from the website where you pay a small fee, but don‚Äôt have the added expense of the dash pass and the up-charge menu items.

It‚Äôs glitchy to get connected to the dasher, and it feels like you have limited time to text them with issues before your order is already ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù. 

I know it‚Äôs not DoorDash‚Äôs fault if items end up missing, but lately it happens often and I really don‚Äôt feel like they update the menus or follow up with restaurants to see if they have the FULL order. They say they do. Not my fault my order keeps getting messed up. They even refused to refund me before because they didn‚Äôt believe my order was missing half of its stuff. 

I missed half of my order today from another place, and they gave me a dollar.. not cool. I noticed the prices on a lot of places aren‚Äôt updated either, so I‚Äôm getting overcharged for things that aren‚Äôt the same price as if I went there. 

Please DoorDash, update your stuff. Your service is garbage. Your app.. is outdated. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating.

As for the app: it has a lot of great restaurant selections and it tells you which ones are open and which ones are not. It also has a tipping system so you won‚Äôt have to worry about looking for tip money in your dirty laundry. The one thing I would change from it is the vague details from some of the restaurants. For example, Wingstop has an item a ‚ÄúLarge Ranch‚Äù that comes at almost $10 and that‚Äôs all it says about it. Not how many ranches you get or why it costs so much.

As I waited for the doorbell to ring I was getting worried they might have been lost, until I received a text saying rate your delivery. At that point I went to check the door, and low and behold, there was my order. However, the driver put it right against the security door and the only way to open it was to knock over the Blizzards. Well, one of the Blizzards ended up with a hole, and I am not sure how long they were there, because all four Blizzards were melted pretty darn good.

They then snuck in other service fees that was almost $10. I reached out to customer service and Isis P was rude, messaged me in slang English, and difficult. Basically asked for proof otherwise they need to escalate the situation. Good thing I don‚Äôt trust these things and took a screenshot. It wasn‚Äôt even a promotion!

1123,DO NOT USE THIS APP DANGER TO WOMEN,False,2019-06-22 02:14:38,1,"Hello all,

Door Dash allows a feature where door dashers can pick up multiple orders at a time. Meaning by the time the driver arrives at your house your food is STONE COLD because they have already picked up food for 3 other people and dropped off already, all while having your food getting cold in the back seat. Way over priced for waiting 2 hours for cold food. After trying to get in contact with the company and it causing more aggravation than anything, I will never use this app again. Would be quicker if I literally walked to the restaurant and back. Clearly this company does not care about its customers or customer service period. 
LASTLY, this service will tell me anglea is coming with my order and somehow a man shows up. This is dangerous because if there is ANY background check in these people AT ALL, then the person who passes this check is not even the person delivering your food. WHO IS DELIVERING YOUR FOOD? You don‚Äôt know. Please all women be safe when using this app. Apparently they do not check the people that are delivering the food to your house. Shame on this app and company.",chelseanigg,

We can handle the paste for the most part unless we are swompt ourselves in the restaurant. I like that door-dash and other companies are so kind and patient with us when we are busy. 
The only issue I have from being someone using the app and being a server myself is that we are not able to tip the server who prepares the food, makes sure it is all right, takes the time to print out a receipt and bring out the order to the personal picking it up. We only get paid a two dollars and change an hour which is barely enough for the amount of work that we do.

First, there‚Äôs the baseline service fee, then there‚Äôs the delivery fee. Then, you need to tip the driver.

Don‚Äôt worry, you can avoid the outrageous delivery fee if you subscribe to the dash pass, and SOME of the service fee (but not all, of course). You‚Äôre still overpaying for food, though.

I have also had nothing but trouble getting orders correctly.  A couple weeks ago I ordered from a restaurant that the app said was open for another hour and that the food would be delivered in 30-40 minutes.  An hour after I placed the order and the driver assigned to get my food hadn‚Äôt even gotten to the restaurant, I called customer support.

I believe they should take the minimum away as the pass members are already paying the monthly fee. It‚Äôs not like people always order big meals or small meals so I believe without the minimum it should even out throughout the month. The minimum order requirement does make people think twice before signing up. I was not aware before signing up so I would be canceling my membership.

Really frustrating when you want to try something new but Wawa and Chick-fil-A come up in every category for whatever reason. It appears that the stores that come up are based on advertisement costs but I am only assuming. It does seem cheaper to order through doordash than UberEats.

After we reached a certain amount of orders almost 99% of our orders from then on were either completely wrong or missing something very important. 

Doordash has two jobs, and they can‚Äôt get either right. For only having two jobs of getting orders correct and delivering them to the right house, doordash only gets our orders correct and at the house on time about 1% of the time these days. And if by chance your food is correct, it will get t you two hours after you ordered it. Its almost like after you‚Äôve been ordering from them for a while you are no longer a priority and are more subject to carelessness in the system, while the new people will forever get the best treatment. 

Lets say Your original order is wrong so you order again in hopes it wont, but theres a 99% this next one will be wrong too and the cycle continues. 

Either doordash needs to only work with restaurants who have true diligent employees who read every direction and get the order accurate

Or doordash needs to no longer operate. This is a business few mistakes can be made in. People pay a lot of money to get doordash food delivered to their door, it better be accurate at least 80% of the time, these days its not even accurate 1% of the time.",yatdepaweiss,

3) they gave me credit which was $11 and some change for door dash.

Unfortunately, their customer service is absolutely terrible. When part of our order was screwed up to the point of not being edible, they only offered us a five dollar credit. That was less than half of the value of the item that was incorrect. Even after calling customer service, which is very hard to get a hold of, they still wouldn‚Äôt refund my service fee. I will literally never order from DoorDash again and advise others to look for better services. They ALSO have bugs to work out though. For example, the restaurant canceled all of our first order except the desert. Since the order had already been placed this means we paid the same amount for tip as we did for our dessert which was the only item actually delivered. It was mostly the restaurants fault but there's no way in the app to negatively review the restaurant and no way to say please don't deliver our order if they cancel everything except the dessert.",Violette Lotus,

Seems strange to me that they would allow such a restaurant on the app. 3) I've referred many people to door dash while with them and never received a $20 credit.

The representative then said they couldn‚Äôt approve it and I would have to speak with a supervisor. I then ask how long it will be, which apparently can be days (So I decide that I do not want to wait and just want a reimbursement on my card.). Before I can type this the representative never asks me if that‚Äôs what I want, and says they are ending our chat communication. I try to start a new chat, and no one is available to help me.

1149,Incredibly Poor Customer Service,False,2022-04-10 04:41:57,1,"My experience with DoorDash had been great in the past but I will never use them again.

I‚Äôm currently at the hospital with my wife; she can‚Äôt leave her room. We used the service to order food from a nearby restaurant and we were notified that the order was picked up. Unfortunately, the driver never showed despite multiple attempts by myself and DoorDash customer service to contact them. I spent well over an hour outside in the cold.

I usually don‚Äôt get worked up about this stuff; I‚Äôve simply canceled orders in the past. But I needed this order at the time delivered. We‚Äôre currently feeding a newborn and our time is limited.

Canceling the order didn‚Äôt work for us nor did waiting out in the cold further and getting a $75 credit - credit that was less than what we paid for after charges, taxes, and tip - for food that would never come.

Now, I understand many of the new internet applications run on algorithms to reduce the need for actual human customer service as much as possible. But trying to get someone on the line took an incredibly long time.

Furthermore, this wasn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúmissed order‚Äù for us but even if you can get an actual human to respond - by text only as far as I can tell
- DoorDash customer service doesn‚Äôt have the ability to color outside lines. It would have been great to have a cancellation and credit due to what happened but unfortunately that‚Äôs impossible.

My recommendations to improve: adding more options to customize orders like Uber Eats offers. Also, I use the apple screenreader, voiceover, for blind and visually impared iPhone users, and many of the buttons in the app are not labelled, which means I often just hear the word button if I try to click on things like add, if I want to do something like add more shots of vanilla to my coffee. The only other suggestion I would make would be to add a passcode that the customer must provide upon delivery, so that not just anyone can claim your food as theirs and steal it from you.

What happens to you is that your food comes cold, soggy, and almost always inedible. Also, it expects you to leave the tip for the Dasher, before they have made the delivery.

Because of this, I don‚Äôt see why the Dasher would have the incentive to make sure that you‚Äôre getting your food warm and edible.

I tried Uber eats, but I‚Äôm too far away for them to deliver IDK how. I honestly don‚Äôt get how Taco Casa isn‚Äôt on DoorDash. But I do love what is already on there.

 I forgot about this review. This is a continuation lol. But, would it be possible to allow building orders for lunch and dinner in the middle of the night so I can have it scheduled for delivery at sometime in the afternoon? I just tried to do that on Wendy‚Äôs but they only have breakfast items.",tacotabi,
1173,App needs work,False,2018-01-21 00:28:27,3,"I have no complaints so far with the delivery service itself. The drivers are friendly and punctual. The restaurant selection is ample. However, the restaurant and menu availability on the app isn‚Äôt as accurate as with other delivery services.

Out of the 8 times I‚Äôve ordered from Door Dash, I‚Äôve had an issue 3 of those times. The first time the restaurant was closed for the season despite being available on the app. The second time the restaurant had to substitute an item since they no longer sold what I ordered. The third time the restaurant simply wasn‚Äôt accepting delivery orders despite the app saying otherwise.

To their credit, Door Dash is always quick about communicating issues, refunding canceled orders, and/or offering an apology credit. However, when one is hungry, it can be frustrating to play Russian Roulette with your delivery app, never knowing if you‚Äôre going to get the dreaded notification that your order can‚Äôt be completed (after you paid).",imqboy,
1174,Garbage customer support,False,2022-09-16 18:31:53,2,"While the app itself is ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù, the user interface was designed by an idiot. 

No way to clear cart without manually deleting each item. Even force closing the app and logging out won‚Äôt do it

No way to leave support chat screen with the chat still open

‚ÄúNeed help with current order‚Äù just defaults to selecting a past order

App repeatedly asks and fails to verify my card.

Now for my experience with customer support. 

During my first attempt I was connected to someone Named Deepak, who clearly wasn‚Äôt paying attention to my problem, as his first 3 suggestions were all negated by my initial description of the problem. 

After accidentally leaving the chat with no way to return due to the aforementioned design flaws made by an idiot,

I attempted a second chat with customer support with someone named Megha. I assume Meghan didn‚Äôt fit, but then again Deepak fits, so who knows. 

Regardless they clearly weren‚Äôt paying attention either, because their first suggestion was that I ‚Äútry using the app instead of the desktop site‚Äù even though I clearly just said that my problem was in the app, and that the app ‚Äúwill only ask to scan the card for verification‚Äù when I specifically said that was the part that doesn‚Äôt work.

1175,Not a Dash,False,2022-07-15 16:15:41,1,"While I do enjoy the easy access to delivery. Being able to get places I don‚Äôt usually for lunch. I have come across a very frustrating hand full of times that have tempted me to avoid using this app all together.

When you set a scheduled time this scheduled time should be followed to the dot to ensure customer happiness and to avoid food going cold. When you don‚Äôt follow a scheduled time, a worker may not get their lunch and be able to eat it on break as an example.

The other issue I run into is the drivers. The drivers DO NOT listen to driver instructions clearly. Most times I‚Äôve had the biggest issue of a driver dropping my food off at the front of my work. Or handing it to a coworker instead of myself. This has made work have strict rules for deliveries. (Not just me who‚Äôs done this, other coworkers)

Driver instructions are important to ensure the right customer gets their order. And most times people REFUSE to look at them until they get a call or text from the customer in a huge fit of rage because they didn‚Äôt listen.

But, back to the app. This app needs some major reworking on how it gets driver, handles scheduled orders, and updates from stores about times being out of stock (no longer available) or are not served. Like when Burger King had ‚ÄúBurgers for Breakfast‚Äù literally lunch items on their breakfast menu. I have had WAY too many of those issues as well.

Not impressed. Also the drivers will never read delivery instructions so if you don‚Äôt want spit in your drink, go outside and meet them. And don‚Äôt tip too much because they never deserve it!

Oh and btw, lets get down to fees, if your food comes from McDonald‚Äôs or any other place you can get a meal for less than 8 dollars, expect to pay a small cart fee of 2 dollars, also know that delivery prices go up during busy hours so order before people usually get hungry. Oh yes, and you tip before the delivery, not after, if you tip like 2 dollars, don‚Äôt be surprised if your order gets rejected, 3 is like the middle ground, and if you play 4 dollars you might just get better service, but most of the time, you might as well have just paid 3.

They only refunded me the delivery fee of $3.99 of a meal that I could not eat due to allergies, which I clearly stated in the special requests section of the item.  This insult lead me to review my account, along with the handful of refunds they said that they were going to make, and guess what I found - out of 10 refunds (over the past 2+ years) they only made 3 refunds. When you ask for a refund make sure to ask for credit within the app, because of you ask for a refund to your card, they don‚Äôt give it.

The latest is that you can enter special instructions for your meal but the instructions won't show up on the actual order.  In some cases this is important due to food allergies (like peanuts).  We did testing and found that for some restaurants the instructions would be passed through on the order when you used the web based app instead of the iOS based app.  For other restaurants the box for instructions wouldn't let you type in it. So who QA's this thing?  When you make software changes you are not supposed to break things that used to work. We are pretty fed up with App problems and considering abandoning Doordash over this!  We have been good customers of Doordash from the day they started, but Doordash needs to remember that their audience in the Bay Area is tech savvy and knows when they are getting a poor app due to sloppy programming/QA.

Two the prices are outrageous for food, its literally cheaper just to go get the food not because your not paying for someone to bring it to you, no.

I have no idea what DoorDash‚Äôs end game would have been had I not called.  At that point literally all of the restaurants in my area were closed so I was pretty much SOL as far as ordering food.

After an hour of waiting I get a call from my delivery driver letting me know about an altercation that happened between her and the management of the restaurant I ordered from. I ask her to please just cancel my order and make sure my full amount is refunded. She apparently cannot do this so I go through the doordash support to fix this, which was relatively quick and easy. Although, it takes 5-7 business days to obtain a refund. I go back to check my account to find out they have now charged me twice for a meal I never even received. I have sent support a screen shot of my bank statement to prove it and they are trying to only give me one refund. So for a meal I never got I have a $120 in charges on my account and I have to wait 5-7 days to get even half of that back. I have yet to find a number to call or anyway to reach someone at doordash except through email. I was excited to use doordash since they have a lot of delivery options but after this experience I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone.",LVBS2018,

Of course I know that isn‚Äôt the driver‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs the restaurants responsibility, but the driver should take their time to confirm with the restaurant to make sure everything is in order. They gave me some in app credit to make up for it. But if I hadn‚Äôt drove myself to the restaurant to get my order redone. I wouldn‚Äôt have eaten the food and have wasted half of the amount of money that was not credited to me as an apology. So not only did I waste time waiting for the food, but I also had to drive myself to the restaurant make a complaint, wait for the food to cook again.  Which all took about an hour and a half. 

So there are some risks using DoorDash. There‚Äôs no way to contact your delivery driver or anyway to fix your order app wise they just automate an apology and throw credits at you. 

Like I said this is just a first experience, I‚Äôll still be using DoorDash a few more times hoping that it was just a rare case of bad luck.",KevinHardt,

Sometimes you keep waiting a long time for food to arrive just to realize that your order was canceled. Customer care is not available to contact at that time as you get message saying no agent available. They would show restaurants which they don‚Äôt work with on their app and also take order for that. Its only later after an hour you realize that restaurant won‚Äôt work for DoorDash. I confirmed this by calling restaurant myself. But the twist is that they charge your credit card right away no matter your order went through or not. Later they‚Äôll give refund of the canceled order but it will take 5-7 business days. Go ahead and install this app only if you want to get charged for a bad order and keep waiting for food that never shows up. Also compare the prices of items from restaurant menu to the DoorDash menu of the same restaurant. Way too pricy!!!!

I will no longer be using the app since there is no was to make the dashers responsible for paying for my infested cold food. I will not make a company pay for some persons irresponsible self. Door dash needs to make it the dashers responsibility to pay for mistakes. 

Also you should have it were the dasher isnt tipped until upon delivery. I am helping these people make money for a living and yet they are not held responsible. So since they are not held responsible then we should be able to tip the upon delivery not before they show up.

A couple phone calls to figure out what to do and at that point the food had been sitting 30 minutes. Not acceptable for sushi.

Then when not receiving items in my order from a restaurant, I alerted door dash through the app to which they said they were unable to refund me.

Other than that I enjoy using the app and I have been refunded for when mistakes are made on my order.
However its only worth it if you get a dashpass since the fees are ridiculous. Plus the pricing on the menu is more expensive than if you went to the restaurant yourself.

App is definitely not for those trying to eat cheap, or save money. it‚Äôs a luxury. I spend around $20 or more each time I use it, since the deals only work if you spend around $15.

My order was picked up and delivered to me by someone OTHER THAN my Dasher. I found it strange that I did not get any sort of order confirmation even and hour after my order arrived. Then my actual dasher called me to tell me that the order was picked up by someone else and that she did not who it was, she proceeded to tell me that it should had been her to pick up my order.

Your system strung me along for over an hour then the driver canceled my order and no ONE called or notified me. Just decided it wasn't going to happen.

I‚Äôm a GM and I use this to fill orders so I get it but to not make sure I was feeling good about the wait was disturbing. You can‚Äôt have the restaurant fix your issues and because they cover or insure on their end the minimum they do is a credit and that wasn‚Äôt even offered as I was upset over the false eta that was given verses after I paid. This needs to be fixed. Take the payment after you find out if the customer is ok with a longer wait than previously given. Not always on drivers but the store could be too busy to take orders.

Lastly, in my area anyway, the available restaurants to order from bar 90% low-level fast food and very few nice restaurants, compared to about 50/50 ratio to fast food and nice restaurants On Uber eats.  Delivery cost is roughly the same for both services. For these reasons I will not be using door ‚Äì again and will stick with Uber eats, which is overall a great service and I can give feedback and tip the amount that I wish after every delivery, as well as order from much higher and restaurants in my area, And talk to an actual person who will straighten it out if there is a problem.",jbm3314,

What happens more often than not is that I‚Äôll tap into one restaurant‚Äôs menu, but when I go back to return to the list of restaurants, I‚Äôm put all the way back to the top of the list.

Typically I order several different dishes and set it up buffet style for my crew to try a little of everything. My boyfriend and I work 60+ hours a week so we use this at least once if not twice a week. 
When I don‚Äôt order buffet style we each individually can order what we want and how we want it made. My food has always arrived in a timely manner though I have on instructions for up the hill and you‚Äôll see a bread truck (my boyfriends) in the driveway. One driver called to ask if it looked like a loaf of bread. I about hit the floor laughing but explained to him no it‚Äôs a delivery truck with pictures on the side. We got to actually order from papa johns on here. We can‚Äôt normally due to ya being like a mile out of their delivery zone. 
Cons: It ruined my favorite restaurant Applebee‚Äôs. Not their fault but for deliveries that restaurants quality goes way down. 
Advice: Don‚Äôt order fast food. It will be cold when you get it. 
Even though restaurants are open later than stated on the app it doesn‚Äôt mean they accept door dash orders until closing. There is a cut off time. 
If there is an issue get on the chat with them and they will help you quickly. Enjoy.",Addles_,

It took DoorDash 50 minutes and our money to figure out and let us know that our order was cancelled.  After that there was no opportunity to call, we could not not seek customer service through a chat, which was a joke and horribly unhelpful.

Additionally, the app will randomly log you out and forget your password, and you‚Äôd be forced to use Uber Eats or the online version instead. Support is useless too and wastes your time asking a bunch of obvious questions. Recently with the pandemic they force you to use online chat instead of calling too because of the high volume of driver and restaurant calls, which tells me everyone is staying at home, but there are problems on that end too. 

Also, sometimes the service works on a VPN, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs too much unrefinement in the app, and it‚Äôs frustrating and dissatisfying the lack of support you get. The number of positive reviews makes me feel the company is probably manipulating the ratings.",poopyploppy,

1266,Food is always later than what it suggests!,False,2020-03-07 03:26:18,3,I use door dash frequently but one of the most frustrating things about the app is that the time it estimates it will take for you to get your food is usually off by 30-40 minutes! I‚Äôve even waited an additional hour to get my food when the time suggested on the restaurant before I submitted my order was only 20-30 minutes. Frustrating because I usually select places based off the suggested wait time and this is not a reliable thing to do anymore. This causes me to rate my delivery people lower than I would like to and I have found that my food is usually not that fresh tasting regardless of when the person picks up the order from the restaurant. The estimated time on the app is deceiving and if I knew food would almost always take an hour or longer I would get the food myself!

I then called the driver who said there‚Äôs nothing he could do, and was going to let doordash know. We went to the airport very hungry and boarded our flight with no food because we gave doordash the benefit of doubt before calling.

My biggest complaint is having missing items or incorrect orders - if you‚Äôre hungry it‚Äôs very disappointing if an item is missing.

I was given credits to compensate me for this but I still had to pay an extra dollar because DoorDash doesn‚Äôt allow $0 orders. So I paid a dollar extra for an order that took twice the time to get to me. DoorDash gave me a notice stating that they don‚Äôt usually refund for these instances but they were making an exception for me.

Time went down to 15 minutes and the driver was at the restaurant. I decided to give them a call and was told that the driver had lost their card and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I called customer service now about 2 hours in. They informed me that they can have another driver pick up my food. By this time the food was probably done 1.5 hours previously. The agent said they could do a refund and would take 5-7 days(I understand this is usual time) but after waiting 2 hours I wanted my money back to go place my own order. The rep, supervisor and supposed manager told me they could replace the order this was already 3 hours in on a Sunday night.

Customer service‚Äôs response was a small credit that doesn‚Äôt even cover 1 of the meals. The final straw happened couple of weeks ago when I returned from work and received a notification saying my order was confirmed. I never placed an order. When I spoke with CS about the issue I only wanted to ensure my money would be returned in full to my bank account. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks without a refund and my account has been disabled.

A year later, I thought ‚Äúwhy not use that credit and give them another shot‚Äù. So, I ordered food to use the credit. Got an error during the ordering. Got a notice that the money was taken from my bank but the order was never actually placed with the restaurant. Was on hold for 20mins trying to find out if my food was coming (took forever to find costumer service number). Submitted complaint to get my money back or food. Have yet to ever receive food from an this second order. Hopefully I can get my money back sooner this time. They have no trouble taking your money (that works great for them).

However, several weeks ago I placed and order and 50 minutes later the driver called me to let me know the restaurant doesn‚Äôt fulfill DoorDash orders.  I asked how I could get a refund and she told me to call DoorDash.  ISSUE ONE, this driver went all the way to the restaurant and now found out the order was never going to be ready. So she will not be getting paid for her time.  Why would they not have an order acknowledgment function and then an order ready for both customers and drivers.

I had to call customer service myself to find out what to do.  Turns out the restaurant marked my order as fulfilled so they had to tell the restaurant to refund my order.  ISSUE TWO: how does the driver or customer service not have the capability to mark that the restaurant didn‚Äôt fulfill the order.

Customer Service told me they asked the restaurant to take themselves off DoorDash.  Two weeks later they were still on.  ISSUE THREE: How does customer service not have the ability to request restaurants removed from DoorDash.

For my first purchase I decided to order from a pizza place 2 miles from my house. I figured it‚Äôs relatively close by it should be an easy delivery.

These people have absolutely no respect on how they talk to people and how they demand their orders immediately and cause a scene.

Most of the time the food is good, but is handled poorly, and the common cause seems to be any dish with a sauce or juices. While some of the dashers handle it well, it‚Äôs mostly delivered with sauce or juices spilled out in the bags and into other food items within the bags. I have a doorbell camera, and after my most recent order, I watched the video and saw the dasher set the food down, then return all of the items in the bags to upright positions prior to ringing the doorbell as if all is well, when it‚Äôs visibly obvious everything is spilled in the bags. I‚Äôve also had dashers that completely did not match the name on the app of the person delivering my order. 

Further, when addressing my order issues on the app, it does not allow you to report all of the issues, but rather one. If I‚Äôm missing items that I paid extra for AND the service was poor, I can only report one or the other, not both. I contacted customer service via chat to let DoorDash know of the actual issues, and they asked me for details.

After emailing them, I got an immediate response and received $5.00 credit towards my next order, which I also placed immediately. The customer service was quick to respond and easy to talk to, so I rate them 4 stars.

Update idea:
Once I allow my location to be seen by the DoorDash app I would like that nearby stores chosen for me would be taken away from my screen if they‚Äôre about to close soon. That way I don‚Äôt have my order canceled and then have to wait to be refunded. Instead it makes an easy and quick process for the customer to decide on what he/she wants.

1346,Door Dash uses your tips to pay their drivers,False,2019-07-22 22:05:09,1,"The service itself is fine, what‚Äôs outrageous is that that every time you tip through the app, they count that as pay to their driver. In other words, if they say a driver will get $6 for delivering your order and you tip $3, they count that as pay and only pay the driver $3. The fact that they don‚Äôt disclose this, and they are using what customers provide as money meant to go directly to the driver as a ‚Äúthanks,‚Äù as pay, is completely immoral and what makes me despise these companies. As if it‚Äôs not enough that they pay so little, now they are using our tips to avoid paying drivers themselves is the icing on this crap cake. I will never use Door Dash again unless this policy is abolished. Are tech companies counting on enough people not being impoverished by this race to the bottom that they can stay afloat? I add tip because I want the driver to make a little extra and I know they aren‚Äôt paid much. I‚Äôm outraged that the company hides the fact that they deduct this from what they owe drivers.

I asked how that was possible and was told that they would do research again, I just needed to hold again. After half an hour of being told by the representative that both the app and I were wrong I called the restaurant to find out if the food had been picked up. It had not. After telling the representative this I was offered to cancel my order and get a refund and I would get a confirmation email. About 15 minutes later when I checked the app the order said it was still in progress. I had to enter a new chat with a second rep just to get done what the first rep said they had done.

When he finally arrives, he has food from three different places sitting on and around his front seat and not in the red bag. His young child was sitting in the backseat and apologized for his dad. The driver did apologize and explained the reason for the delays. I might have let it go except the food was cold and soggy and not worth the wait.

The reason for the ‚Äúlow‚Äù rating is everything that happens after the order is put in. The tracking of the orders is absolutely horrible. In almost every instance of my use of the application (in my current location) the timing has been very off. Yesterday the application told me my dasher was the restaurant when they were actually already waiting outside.

It‚Äôs totally fine if they get here early, or are a little late. But accurate tracking of the order and arrival based on the dashers location shouldn‚Äôt be so inaccurate. It usually ends up in someone waiting outside for longer than necessary (myself of the dasher).

It works, you get your food, but it‚Äôs definitely quicker and sadly sometimes more convenient to just go pick it up yourself. If I had had that option while on vacation I wouldn‚Äôt have used the app as much. 

My results with GrubHub are much better and I think it might be in part to the application and tools. If the communication to the client is bad I can only imagine the dashers application experience.",Sachocho,

One is a personal account that delivers to my home, one is a work account that delivers personal meals, and one is a work account that delivers meals biweekly for the entire office. Several weeks ago we checked the status of our office order at lunch time only to find out the entire order was cancelled because one person ordered steak rather than someone calling for an alternate order. We were called by 2 more drivers to notify us that they arrived to pick up our order but it was cancelled. Then I was charged $1.25 for free salsa at a local Mexican restaurant. After several emails notifying me that the system was down due to high volume of emails I was finally notified that I would not receive a refund for my $1.25 and they would rather lose my business.

But now I can get anything to eat or drink at anytime of the day or night. The additional availability of the convenience stores and others has made my life so much easier and happy. I additionally love that my Dashers even check to be sure I can reach my delivery by putting on the front door mat so I can reach it from inside the house since I can‚Äôt get outside on the porch to get to the package.

I would like to know how you think a person is supporting themselves with a one dollar tip?! If you‚Äôre so cheap that you don‚Äôt want to tip your driver an acceptable living wage then maybe you should go pick up your own food for yourself. I would like to acknowledge and thank any customer that actually gives us drivers a reasonable tip. Unfortunately since I started delivering for DoorDash to supplement Uber eats deliveries there have been very few if any reasonable tips left. Uber eats pays much better than DoorDash for a driver. DoorDash needs to encourage people to leave a tip for good driving and delivering services. Maybe somethings should be added to the end of a delivery such as a notification asking them if they would like to leave an additional tip for their driver.

One item missing entirely, and the other two cold (as you might expect after that long). The delivery driver was nice enough, but referred us to support to voice our concerns. That‚Äôs when things really fell apart. 

The first customer service agent was unable to provide any compensation or additional delivery to get the food that we actually paid for. When we spoke to the manager he treated us with disrespect, made it seem like he was doing us a favor by compensating ten bucks, and then asked us to leave a review of our experience. I told him politely that I would be honest with my review, in the sense that I would mention his rudeness during our conversation.

To this day I have got 2 apologies and been reactivated only to have a email follow up right after saying I was once again deactivated for violating terms that no one can seem to explain to me. I have frequently given the reference number of the few people who apologized for the unconvinced and said it was a mistake to the new people who would help me and say it was simply because I violated terms and it seems like they never acknowledge it and go about their day collecting their easy as checks. As nice as that sounds to do I believe the customer deserves better that employees with that attitude who don‚Äôt do their due part of the job insuring customer satisfaction.

Eventually you  get cold old food just been bounced from driver to driver until some driver really desperate for money funny text your order. But then drivers do shady stuff to your food because they think they‚Äôre not getting tipped properly. 

GrubHub treats its drive well and  does not do this to the drivers and shows the driver what they will actually make on the delivery instead of hiding it like doordash does.  So if you tip well you will get five star service on GrubHub unlike doordash where you‚Äôre gonna get treated the same as a person that doesn‚Äôt tip at all because doordash hides the tips.

When you don‚Äôt get your food, Doordash will give you a refund, but not for the total value (on top of that, the frustration of not getting your food). 
Also, there are a few drivers that don‚Äôt even speak a word in English, which makes it really hard to help them find your house when they are having issues.

I ordered from a Chinese restaurant that I thought was on one street and was an excellent Chinese place. It wasn‚Äôt until after I ordered (and could not cancel) that I realized my fav Chinese restaurant had the EXACT same name as a different Chinese restaurant that has terrible food in our area. The restaurants were a similar distance in different directions and the only indication of location they give you is the distance in miles. That doesn‚Äôt work when everything is close. Add addresses so we know which locations we are ordering from.

You don‚Äôt even give a full refund on something that‚Äôs your fault on a user who‚Äôs never complained before. I work often with your drivers and they never grab the whole order!

I immediately contacted customer service and they said that they could not issue me a refund and sited some policy and case by case review process.

I told them that was unacceptable and that it was also illegal not to refund me for something undelivered regardless of any ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù. 

This is not the first time this has happened with this company. They have done this to me on more than just this one occasion. 

If their system thinks (for lack of a better word) that you have gotten too many ‚Äúcredits‚Äù for messed up, incomplete or missing item it will not allow any more ‚Äúcredits‚Äù to be issued on the account.

This is unacceptable. First of all these are in no way ‚Äúcredits‚Äù they are legitimate customer refunds for items not delivered, completely incorrect, or whatever the issue may be, etc.

Immediately called the store bc after 5 min doordash wouldn‚Äôt let me cancel it, since the restaurant had already accepted it. The food hasn‚Äôt been started yet, so the manager of the restaurant cancelled the order and told me I‚Äôd be refunded through doordash. It never happened. I didn‚Äôt receive an email or confirmation or anything. Since then I‚Äôve emailed and messaged and reported to doordash several times, with just auto generated responses.

That never happened. Here it is an hour later, and the restaurant wants to charge $21 to the driver, when I already paid my $18 and change. And DoorDash is so poorly ran as a company, that they can‚Äôt solve what I find to be a very simple issue. Your customer service is abysmal. Your help page is nothing but garbage fluff. Someone will reach out to me in 24-48 hours, eh? Well I‚Äôm hungry now. I ordered my food over an hour and a half ago. So your 24-48 hours is a disrespectful slap in the face.

I can‚Äôt even cancel the order since it was live and now I have to spend the next 10 mins with customer support while they put me on hold as they try to contact the restaurant. Eventually they come back and confirm it and from here on, all that happens is I get the order amount in DoorDash credits and they‚Äôre ‚Äòsorry for the inconvenience‚Äô. 

Why the restaurant can‚Äôt inform DoorDash and why they can‚Äôt step in and cancel the order or update me sooner is beyond me. A system needs to be in place to look out for the customers because there is a lot of unpredictability in such situations.",arw1788,

There‚Äôs one less than a mile away but for some reason the only available store was 4 miles away, which I didn‚Äôt realize until after I‚Äôd ordered. 45-50 min.

I ordered a Pizza a bit before 5:30 pm. The app estimated I would receive my order in about 45 to 55 minutes - pretty standard for most deliveries for any app in my area - except with other services my food actually arrives within that time frame.
Needless to say, 50 minutes has passed and not a single person has accepted to deliver my order. So I contacted customer service chat and they told me the estimated delivery time would be 6:24 because the place I ordered from was still making my food.

10 minutes pass and someone finally accepts to deliver my order.

IF YOU DONT HAVE AVAILABLE DRIVERS TO DELIVER ORDERS - DONT ACCEPT ORDERS UNTIL YOU DO. Otherwise you force the person to wait double the amount of time to receive what they have PAID EXTRA for to have you deliver it to them.

I asked for a phone number to speak to someone, that never happened. The driver never contacted me to tell me of any problem, and I never got to speak to anyone. As a consumer, I find that absolutely unacceptable!  I‚Äôm never using this service again, and will tell everyone I know to never use this service, because they don‚Äôt give a crap about their customers...as long as they get their money.

Then don‚Äôt lie and say there is no delivery fee and sneak in your fee as ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù. Dishonest!  The last two times I got delivery there were items missing.  These weren‚Äôt huge orders - 4 items in one and 5 items in the other.  When it takes an hour to get your food and it‚Äôs missing items - you‚Äôre screwed.  Also the app requires you to add your tip when you place your order.  A tip is for good service.  Why are we tipping before the service has been rendered?  Maybe if the tip was given at the end - like with Uber - the delivery people would be motivated to do a better job like make sure your order is correct.

Today I placed an order than arrived an hour late and was completely wrong. I could only get a partial credit to the app. I had to google the number for their customer service and request a refund directly to my card. Then then tried to say I wouldn‚Äôt get the delivery fee refunded. The order was so late and totally wrong and I still have to pay the delivery fee?

When I did call door dash back to complain she said she would take note of it and she would send me an email link where I could put my complaint in and they review it. By this point I want my money back. The lady never sent me the link to my email and I never received any credit from them messing up on my food.

I try and communicate with the drivers and ask them if they‚Äôre having trouble finding the apartment and the last two times I have gotten someone who could hardly understand me due to hardly speaking English and hang up on me when I‚Äôm trying to give them directions. When my food arrived damaged and cold because a delivery driver who only spoke Spanish was delivering my food I called and asked for a refund and they offered me $5 credit in replacement of my $40 order.

I also have used it on vacation when going out of state you can change your key location to where you are staying at and the app will search for stores near you in vacay location that uses door dash. It‚Äôs very convenient user friendly to use and it authenticates every transaction. I have had an issue once when the restaurant itself couldn‚Äôt provide the food during high tempo busy hours but I was contacted and reimbursed with Door Dash credit which I was okay with because I use Door Dash often.

In terms of app running, it‚Äôs pretty okay. Usually the tracker works well and chats send quickly. I haven‚Äôt personally had any major issues with dashers delivering to me, besides them clearly not reading the *dont block my door please* sign, but whatever. 

I will be cancelling my dashpass as soon as the year I paid for is up though, because of 2 major things:
1. Lack of reward/incentive 
2. Horrible Customer service/resolutions

Out of all the food delivery apps, doordash is the only one that will very rarely offer good coupon codes or rewards for using them. $3 off every once in a while compared to the regular $20 off I get from ubereats & I don‚Äôt even have their premium. The best codes are when you pick up your own food, which kinda defeats the entire purpose of the app imo. 

Secondly, it‚Äôs always a gamble for your customer service. I‚Äôve had quick easy solutions but also literally *no* solution offered when whole meals were missing from my order. Ultimately you may lose money & potentially an entire meal, and the best they will tell you is ‚Äúsorry for the inconvenience‚Äù.

Unfortunately I just experienced the third time consecutively within three months of ordering food using DoorDash where the food arrived an hour late, cold, and delivered by an unapologetic unprofessional driver.  Almost trying to make it seem like the late delivery was my fault even though I watched on the GPS says the driver drove in the wrong direction for about 20 minutes, made another stop off for about 15 minutes, and then took 35 minutes to figure out how to get to my place.
I‚Äôm going to give the reading two stars because I am hoping that this type of chronic problem is regional. I live in the Albany New York capital District area.

To those in charge, dependable quality drivers are what make or break a service like this.  In the food delivery industry, you are responsible as couriers for upholding not only your own reputation, but the reputation of your vendors. I‚Äôm sure that the managerial aspect of your company realizes this, but I‚Äôm not so sure that the drivers under your employ understand the concept fully.

3) Make certain that your drivers aren‚Äôt hungry or have the munchies when doing a delivery

The dashers will shrug off their mistake to double check everything that was on the order. They‚Äôll say they will end up calling the restaurant, or giving you credits.
Regardless you‚Äôll end up with less than half your order most of the time. Customer service is not much of a help either. It bums me out that this app has so many good reviews when it‚Äôs actually really sketchy and operated terribly! After a year of using DoorDash, I‚Äôm throwing in the towel.

I have been using this app for a few months and I have had very few issues with it. Most deliveries have gone smoothly and are very convenient when I don‚Äôt have time to make food myself. Where I live is slightly hard to find so I include detailed instructions to find my residence. However, some dashers seem to not read special delivery instructions which ends up causing the delivery to take longer.

No Door Dash customer service number advertised. Found a number on Reddit and the person who answered could only forward it to a supervisor. Not sure how that is going to get me dinner. Used my debit card and order went through. I just don‚Äôt like giving debit card info out. Oh well, all‚Äôs well that ends well. The bottom line is that for about 30-50% more than you would pay in the store, a friendly person is going to rush over to where you are with hot food...pretty hard for a company to beat that and earn money at the same time.",Pete was already taken,

- Last two orders from different restaurants were missing items

- Says Dasher is ‚Äúpicking up your food‚Äù or ‚Äúon the way‚Äù, but you can watch them on the map sitting there not moving for 15 minutes and more; sometimes they drive different places entirely (there‚Äôs no quality controls)

- App is highly quick to load in order to receive orders and generate sales, but slowed or shows an error when you try to report a problem or ask for chat

- Among all of the above, restaurants markup their prices on the app (compared 3 restaurants with app prices vs restaurant), and you have to tip the dasher at the time you order so you‚Äôre out of luck if you have a bad delivery experience.

1576,Long Delays due to SOFTWARE,False,2022-09-03 05:26:37,2,"Because of the way the app is structured, a Dasher is obligated by a point system to accept a second delivery order without enough detail to determine if the first delivery order would still have the ability to be delivered in a timely manor. Dasher is in fact penalized for not accepting a second order, even though the first customer received cold and soggy food. The ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù center has no mention or remedy of this VERY common issue, and only gives the option to complain about the Restaurant or the Dasher. This is not respectful of the makers of the product sold, the independent contractors that facilitate the majority of this app‚Äôs duties, and especially the consumer that provides the revenue to support the lavish lifestyles of the investors and corporate officers who feel this is acceptable and that they have no need to improve the aspect of this company that they are directly involved in.

Not to mention back in 2020 i was driving for uber and lyft Fast forward to this year. I apply again. My background check comes back clean. They still will not approve me to drive. I have been getting the run around saying they have to run my background again and someone will be emailing me back in 10 days . This is crazy as i have to constantly call them and when i do get someone on the phone they have no answers for me .They are terrible.

My food is now routinely cold, and yesterday for the first time I received something I didn‚Äôt order, and there is no way to contact anyone to complain.

It declines my card on multiple occasions when trying to complete my order, even when I have sufficient funds on my card. When trying to contact them in regards to this happening recurrently there was no way to get ahold of a representative. I was astonished! How? What if there is something wrong with my order?

This imposter, sent nasty dry French toast saying they had no pancakes, dried over cooked eggs, and under cooked grits. I called with no answer. They should change their name. They are not even affiliated with the popular L. George‚Äôs on W. McNichols. Make sure you have the correct location when ordering. Some places should not be allowed to open their doors.",Yahmeelah,

I proceeded to tell them that I did get in contact with DoorDash & was assured that a refund would be processed that is why I didn‚Äôt think to call back within 3 days. I got hung up on.

My order was confirmed, the dasher confirmed pick up of the food, he was on the route and then suddenly started going off the route. He went down different streets. And then suddenly my order was cancelled before I could get in contact with him. After talking to DoorDash support, they said he canceled for vehicle issues or had an accident. I highly doubt that. It was obvious he stole the food and wasted our time and now the gift my mom was expecting is not coming. I don‚Äôt even wanna reorder because they might steal food too and use this same excuse.

1608,Lack of options,False,2021-08-15 00:27:27,2,"Hi,
I was really excited that delivery apps were expanding in Alaska. But then I was disappointed with the app settings. You are limited by your listed city address as apposed to a set mileage radius. I live above two towns one has everything the other not so much just roughly 5 options and not even good ones. You need to adapt to market needs everywhere is not the same. City miles and rural miles are very different. 12 miles in Alaska is a short distance compared to 12 miles in La, Chicago, or New York. Google is available to everyone to see what restaurants are in an area. A in person visit for fast food is $30-50 easy here. Being able to get pizza delivered is a service people would pay for. The average family here has 4+ kids. Getting food delivered is a convenience people will pay for.

I very much enjoy having the option to order food delivery for a reasonable price, and DoorDash does just that. Not feeling like driving 4 miles to get your favorite burrito? Done, DoorDash has you covered. I like the idea that a food delivery service like DoorDash not only delivers many delectable hole-in-the-wall food goodies, but also affords the opportunity to make extra cash when you feel like doing some dashing yourself!

1610,A few problems I have noticed about DoorDash,False,2021-05-01 16:26:34,2,"I have a few comments about how DoorDash works. First, if you ever order a drink, expect to not get it. Maybe 2/5 times when ordering a drink have I ever gotten it. Second, you should not allow drivers to wait on another order in the midst of delivering one. I once had to wait an extra 45 minutes for my order because the driver was waiting on another order maybe 5 minutes away from my drop off location. Why not drop it off & then collect the second order AFTER? Third, why do we get a notification asking us to wear a mask when meeting our driver given that once again, maybe 2/5 of my drivers ever wear one themselves? I have no problem wearing my mask, so i feel it should be required of your drivers to wear them as well when meeting face to face (which is the option I choose ONLY if I am at work ordering, every other time I choose contactless.)",sav_v6,

The consumer, provides the tip which, isn‚Äôt payment for a working wage but, a tip (meaning extra, complimentary) to at least, minimum wage that your company should be paying its drivers. How dare you suggest a 20% tip for less than, half of full service! Your company should be providing insurance, gas, and pay for ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù for the driver‚Äôs vehicles when, they‚Äôre on your time, too!

Only after eating and becoming ill did I realize and call the restaurant directly to learn that DoorDash CALLS in all orders, so the restaurant cannot see what you order and the DoorDash agent ordered my pizza incorrectly. Now, 4 days later, after many attempts to get through to someone and complain did I finally receive a credit. Money can‚Äôt give me back the 3 days I was sick because of their mistake, and I certainly shouldn‚Äôt have had to message them repeatedly. What a joke.

1613,Horrible Dashers,False,2020-07-01 23:59:52,1,"I have been using DoorDash for over a year now, wasted a lot of money using it, but that‚Äôs the cost of convenience. I have seldom ever had an issue, until recently. This past month, June 2020, I have had numerous issues. You would think with the food delivery boom of this pandemic, service would be fantastic but it hasn‚Äôt been.

One issue was that I had ordered a Blizzard with my meal from DQ. I understand that under pandemic guidelines Dashers cannot inspect the food to make sure it is correct, HOWEVER, a blizzard comes in a drink cup, it does not get out into a bag, HOW DO YOU MISS THAT?!

Most recent issue: I ordered Chinese and the app told me approximately 30 minute wait. Five minutes passes and it tells me they upped it another 20 minutes; maybe the Dasher was busy, I do not know for sure, but if he was, I would‚Äôve rather they reject the order, pass on to someone else, or cancel it altogether. On the app, you can see where the Dasher‚Äôs vehicle is at to monitor their progress, and this Dasher waiting in another restaurant parking lot for upward of 10 minutes before he even moved to get my food.

I do not mind having to wait for food, but if they are too busy to handle orders, they SHOULD NOT accept my order. And is it really that difficult to make sure I have the correct food?

I will likely never order DoorDash again until this pandemic is over, rather go through another service or use delivery service directly through restaurant.",DDealer797,

So, they still keep all their fees even though their service wasn‚Äôt completed. That‚Äôs scam like behavior. You‚Äôre better off not wasting your MONEY. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a feature that would tell you whether or not there are drivers around like all the other apps do, that way you could avoid wasting money for something you‚Äôll never get delivered to you. I mean come on, $8 out of $30?! Are you kidding me?! So you kept the other $22 for what? You didn‚Äôt earn or deserve it. You just scammed me out of your money.

My food order doesn‚Äôt get processed for about 10 minutes, the restaurant has to make the food so about another 20, and then the driver takes 50 minutes to get here? How is that a fast delivery? Don‚Äôt even think about canceling your order, they refund LESS than half the pay amount. It takes even longer to get your food if the dasher picks up someone else‚Äôs while delivering yours. I have watched many drivers pick up my food, go the opposite way and pick up someone else‚Äôs AND deliver theirs first. So by the time I get mine the food is cold and soggy.

I then called in to the customer service number and they told me that I should have been warned ahead of time but I wasn't and when asked who I need to peak to appeal the decision to deactivate my account they said there was no one that the ""investigative team"" investigates automatically and send findings to escalation team who should contact us via phone or email.

They try to tell you that there‚Äôs no delivery fee so you feel like you‚Äôre getting a good deal but if your order is over 80 bucks then you are spending over eight dollars, and for what?

So no firefighters there to pick up the stuff. The coffee and things got left in the heat for two hours and door dash was like sorry we can‚Äôt help you or give refund for the milk products. Cool, lack of respect for the fire service. Needless to say I‚Äôm done with door dash. Fire fighters do not show up without a water hose and always help! Door dash is a poor example of helping this community all together. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle. Im going back to before Covid ways and there was no door dash!!! Normal!",Insley1008,

All the dashers I‚Äôve had have been top notch, and their work has made a huge impact during the pandemic. The issue I have is with the app itself. Sometime within the last few years it updated so that, in the screen with the map where you can track your dasher, the information listing your order and advertising other things you can dash covers up 90% of the map. The map is way more useful than anything else on that screen because it allows me to help if the dasher can‚Äôt find my house, or if there‚Äôs any issues etc. I want to be able to see the map. And I can‚Äôt see the map if all this crap is covering a majority of it. Make the map bigger and the information smaller, and maybe I‚Äôd give it a higher rating.",The technicolor whiscash,

That being said, Doordash will pounce on the first opportunity to note a negative mark on your delivery times and threaten you with deactivation even if all of your other orders (ALL) have been on time or early.

Today that changed. My DoorDash driver this morning opened my order from Einstein, breaking the seal on the bag. There were 2 items missing. The rest were dumped out on the ground in front of my door.

When bringing this up to DoorDash, their offer was to refund 50% back as a credit in the app, or they would replace one item but not both. When I asked why, they said I didn‚Äôt bring up both items were damaged so even though it spilled all over the ground, I should eat what I could and not waste food. 

In addition, I was accused of trying to get free food, and then the agent ended the chat without resolving the problem.

This is unacceptable customer service. Unfortunately, this has happened before with DoorDash, and another time when I was working as a driver for them. (They didn‚Äôt resolve a question, instead they unexpectedly disabled my driver account and refused explanation.)

DoorDash is a horrible company. They only want to take your money and do not support their customers or drivers.

Each restaurant has a delivery fee listed; but in addition to that you have a service fee (11%) attached to every order, a ‚Äúsmall order‚Äù fee if you order less than the minimum, and the dasher tip. For small order, the fees and the tip double the price I pay for the food! I‚Äôve also noticed that the menu prices differ from the restaurant prices.

The restaurant also called me twice to confirm I don‚Äôt want this order and I want to cancel it.

But two hours later, DoorDash app said I was charged and the order was completed. I believe DoorDash still assigned a dasher to this order and when the dasher showed up in the restaurant, he/she asked the restaurant to prepare for this order. I contacted the second DoorDash agent. The agent confirmed with me that the first agent did help me cancel this order, but there are system errors. The agent escalated this issue to their escalation team.

I waited for more than 24 hours but all I got back from the escalation team is an email written in a standard template by a bot saying that the refund request is not approved by DoorDash‚Äôs policy.

3) issue 2) becomes important as we have found that the prices on the Dash app are often much higher than if we had ordered from the restaurant directly.

They offer you an amount back. That is your only option to take what is offered. Most restaurants who provide you with an incorrect order will reimburse you and go above to make up for it. (Speaking as a restaurant manager!) There is no above with door dash. Always get the credit back to your bank account. If you apply that credit to the next order that may be incorrect you basically have tossed that money out as I just did. Packaging the product for to go is often destructive to the food quality.

This has happened to us twice now and thankfully both times the restaurant canceled our order and Door Dash did refund our money but this situation is frustrating when your at work and have very few lunch options.

Door Dash gives you a free trial, which is nice, and then it‚Äôs only $9.99/month to stay signed up with Dash Pass, their membership comes with free delivery and other perks including promotions.

I have only been using this service for about a week, but so far it has been very good. And the ten bucks per month is about one to two average delivery fees, depending on restaurant or business. I pretty much always get at least one delivery per month, so it basically pays itself off on the first one or maybe two delivery fees.

So I closed out Chrome and tried it though Explorer... same thing, no response. After 10 minutes of trying to get my payment info in, I decided to download the app. So finally after another 10 minutes I was able to order through the app. Mind you, I was already starving when I first tried ordering online. So now I‚Äôm extra hungry. So I order through the app, I continue working (I‚Äôm at work) and 10 minutes later I get a phone call that the place I ordered from was closed! Ok, so do I get an immediate refund since I have to now cancel my order and use another service or go somewhere else? Nope! I‚Äôll get my refund in 7-10 business days. Cool!

Far more times than not, a complaint is met with a laughable reimbursement that‚Äôs usually about 10% of the amount you paid for it originally.  Even when ordering from high end restaurants. No special consideration for consistent faithful customers is given. 
When I spend $10 on drinks and that order is wrong, the reimbursement should be $10, at least but certainly more than $1.17.   
This is not an isolated event. This happens at least 25% of the time. Today, I lost it an agitation, and cancelled my premium DoorDash account after 6 years.  I spend on average $1,500 per month with DoorDash and they are now permanently loosing my business to Uber eats, over a soda.

However, my latest order the whole thing was messed up sides and main, and they refused to refund me for the whole meal. When it was only $30 out of a $90 order. I asked customer service to refund me the whole meal instead of just for the sides and they refused and ended the chat in a very rude way. As soon as I receive my partial refund, I will be deactivating my account and only ordering through other services since I cannot go through their customer service anymore.

Last order, I had to drive to Chick-Fil-A to get my daughter‚Äôs order because the Dasher didn‚Äôt check the bag.  Going to get my missing order defeats the purpose of having the Door Dash service.

When a restaurant forgets an item, it only refunds the price of the item and tax, not tip. So if they screw up, you still lose 15%.  There‚Äôs no way to rate door dash‚Äôs performance in an order. Only the restaurant or dasher. If door dash closes a bad algorithm for order of deliveries, timing, etc, there‚Äôs no way to note this.

The customer shouldn't be penalized for the other party messing up. If you pay for a service and items, you should of course be able to receive it. Otherwise that's literally theft.

There‚Äôs no way to give accurate feedback on issues. The only thing you can do is leave a star rating. If you leave a low star rating, you risk getting an unwanted call or text from the dasher complaining about the bad rating. 
In order to address and fix issues, you have to go on the website and get in touch with the customer service through online chat which can be very time consuming and completely counters the convenience you are desiring.

Most people like to eat their food with certain sauces but there is no where on the app to add a sauce. Even if i was to use the ‚Äúspecial instruction‚Äù button, the drivers and restaurant associates do not care and they don't follow the ‚Äúspecial instruction‚Äù prompt.

But let‚Äôs say that i don‚Äôt like cheese on my burger but everything else was fine!

Let‚Äôs start with the fact that this app doesn‚Äôt give you the FULL menu of every restaurant. If you are cash savvy, good luck trying to find your perfect value option on their menu. Or, let‚Äôs say the restaurant is running a promotion. Something like a 2 for $5 deal. You absolutely won‚Äôt find it on the menu on this app. I even chatted with customer service to tell them, and they told me it would be taken care of. This was just one instance. Of course the issue I brought up has not been resolved. 
No option for dipping sauces is available on any menu that I‚Äôve tried to order from. 
If this company wanted to dominate any competitors, they would tackle these issues immediately. 
But, I guess corporate greed, and shoddy management rules the day. No respect for the customer. 
If this company hired me, I guarantee you I would make profits soar, because I understand the customer mind, and how much people (aka your potential customers), take pride in their food orders, as well as finding the deals that restaurants offer. 
Skip on this app until they fire all of management, and get people in there who will actually do the work. People who know fast food and not priceless menus.

I text them asking if they were going to pick up the food as they hadn‚Äôt moved in 40 minutes and they said no, but did nothing to cancel the task on their end. In the DoorDash app, there was no way to request a new driver or get it reassigned. It just stayed stuck on this jerk with no intention of delivering the item. There was no easy way to reach doordash support. I had to go to an old order to finesse a way to get chat support.

When using this app, only a quarter of the menu items are available to add to your order. (Taco Bell specifically). After you dig through all the weird categories to find the menu items you want, you then have to go through all the steps to pay for your food. After you enter in all your card info, you select your delivery address. After going through ALL THAT WORK, DoorDash tells me that they aren‚Äôt able to deliver to my house. I am exactly 1.6 miles away from the selected Taco Bell location. DoorDash can deliver Subway (2.2 miles away) but not Taco Bell.

Very frustrating that you need to go through all this work to be told you can‚Äôt even order your food. Not a user friendly app at all.

When you order a meal for delivery on Door Dash, Door Dash gets the order and phones it into the restaurant. So the person calling the order has to speak clearly and leave a phone number with the restaurant in case there are problems. With my order a problem occurred due to communication errors between Door Dash and the restaurant. I was not informed until an hour had passed that my order was cancelled. To add insult to injury they said my card will get refunded from 5 to 7 days. Are they kidding? Does not the technology exist to submit a refund to a credit card company electronically?  Is Door Dash submitting the refund on a carbon copy receipt form sent in via US mail? Is door dash mocking me? And as a finale I was not allowed to submit a new order for an alternate dish. Basically Door Dash dumped me and offered no recourse. So I downloaded Post Mates and placed my order with them instead.",AliasSee,

I know i like to look at the location of the restaurant i am ordering from.
- more driving buttons. A lot of time i cant just simply go back to the previous page i was on. I have to remember all the specific menu bar features and it is annoying.

However, trying to communicate with him to let him know he was at the wrong address was a nightmare.  Calling and texting goes out to some fugazi generic door dash number - neither are successful as the call immediately drops while the delivery person seems to never receive the text.  Furthermore, when the delivery guy initially called me to come down, the call was tagged ‚Äúscam likely‚Äù - door dash might want to get that rectified with networks or the fcc.

1788,Getting extremely expensive..And frequent late delivery,False,2019-07-23 22:08:18,2,"This app I felt was excellent in the beginning..They charged reasonable fees for delivery from places that normally dont deliver..

Lately their ‚Äúfees‚Äù are becoming too high..Also they are charging a delivery fee from places that will deliver to you free if you just call them directly..Im sorry but thats pretty absurd..

Tonight for example I was going to order sushi on the app..The food itself cost about $28 dollars..After all the fees involved including a 2.99 delivery fee(not including tip), the bill jumped to $38..Wow

That turned me off so much I just looked up the restaurant on google, and saw that they offered free delivery..I called my order in instead in 3 mins, and saved myself $10..

Now $10 isnt a ton of money, but its enough in my opinion not to use door dash uselessly when theres no reason for it..

Also, they are having a lot of trouble of late giving realistic delivery estimates and keeping their promises in this area.

This was evidenced to me with this restaurant tonight..Doordash was giving an estimate of delivery of 30 minutes..When I called the restaurant directly?  Their estimate was 50 mins to an hour..

Thats about a 20 to 30 minute discrepency, which is no joke when youre waiting for food..

This app has alot to work on in my opinion as far costs, delivery estimate times, and actual delivery times in my opinion..",MikeySett,

On pretty much every order it will say 35-45 min for delivery but as time goes by it doesn‚Äôt adjust or time goes down then back up so you can‚Äôt keep track of them actually sticking to the time you expected upon placing an order.

I spoke to customer service that moment, and she reimbursed me the total plus the 11$ tip. She also gave me door dash credits that I didn't intend to use. I asked a couple days later with two different customer service representatives, to transfer the credits to my account. Instead of explaining to me that they couldn't do that because its a compensation, the one agent gently argued and didn't explain anything. The second agent went ahead and tried to reimburse me the entire refund without asking me what i needed help with. Overall, they took away the credit. I deleted the app.",mvesely17,

**UPDATE: So after all that failed I had to go use another service. I ordered with them and had it on time. After I ate I received a push notification saying my DoorDash order was on its way! I CANCELED THE ORDER TWICE PEOPLE! And I felt bad for the driver lady and didn‚Äôt want to waste her time so I accepted the order. I emailed DoorDash and spoke to them about the issue and they emailed me back and said they were sorry and couldn‚Äôt help me out with at least a coupon or something. I will never use them again.

1845,Pros and Cons,False,2019-11-25 05:19:21,3,"Pros: I like that the app lets me tip upfront, so drivers don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm scamming them like Postmates drivers must think, when I have to tip them on the app. I also like that this app is usually a couple dollars less than PM. The last pro is that if I have an order canceled by PM because they can‚Äôt find a driver to take it (probably because they can‚Äôt see that I‚Äôm going to tip), DoorDash usually has a driver available for the same order. 
Cons: I hate that they don‚Äôt ever have promo codes for existing customers, like Postmates does (PM constantly sends me discounts in my email and alerts). I also hate that they don‚Äôt allow you to place any requests, like ‚Äúno mayo‚Äù on anything you order. They also don‚Äôt include the full menu. For example, at one restaurant they don‚Äôt list any beverages that aren‚Äôt gallon size. So, if I want a lemonade with my lunch at that restaurant , I have to order from Postmates.",<3 Angi,

That is the only bad experience I‚Äôve had with them, but the reason I won‚Äôt be using it anymore is that I addressed this to them on the app and they have yet to contact me back.

Second experience: driver has detailed instructions to my apartment. Ignores the instructions and demands that I come outside. I ignored him because that‚Äôs not a delivery and he came upstairs.

He kept trying to call me so I blocked him. 3 days later he is still calling me from fake numbers and I am freaked out.

Look I‚Äôm not a lazy person but if I wanted to get up and go out then I would have went and picked up food myself. I pay a delivery fee sometimes of five dollars and a tip on top of that plus the price of my food, so I expect my food to be delivered to my door. The app is called DoorDash not front desk. Screen your drivers more and get people who can speak English because this is absurd. I understand that a lot of people speak different languages but English is primarily the language in United States if you cannot speak it you should not be in customer service.

1852,No Customer Service,False,2019-06-18 02:16:59,1,"I don‚Äôt recommend DoorDash. My order was wrong and they did nothing about it. The delivery man just blamed the restaurant. When I submitted a request and feedback to DoorDash, I got nothing.  Absolutely no response. The problem isn‚Äôt that they didn‚Äôt do anything about it... It‚Äôs that they didn‚Äôt respond. The other issue is that, you‚Äôre required to apply the tip before the service. That means even if they don‚Äôt deserve a tip because of the poor service, you‚Äôre stuck paying it.  So you‚Äôre better off not tipping at all unless you want to be left with the feeling of leaving a tip for terrible service. 

The reality is DoorDash is not a unique service so the only thing that separates this from one of the several other food delivery service is customer service.  DoorDash clearly lacks customer service so unless you want to give your money to a company that doesn‚Äôt care, don‚Äôt use it.

1875,Quality Control Decreased,False,2021-09-19 00:23:14,3,I‚Äôve spent A LOT of money with Door Dash over the years and recently it seems like either restaurants don‚Äôt care to fill the full order or the drivers aren‚Äôt being careful with their pick ups and drop offs. I‚Äôve had 4 straight orders that were missing something or something is wrong and after a few orders DD stops offering credit for the mishaps. I understand they have people who abuse the system but I think it‚Äôs time for me to rely on another delivery service. I‚Äôd rather launch a ticket for them to confirm that either the restaurant or driver dropped the ball for my credit than receiving an honor system credit that cuts me off after so many issues because now I‚Äôve paid for something that I didn‚Äôt receive. Maybe they‚Äôll fix their quality control issues in the future.,AnxiousWonder,

The restaurant was making our food slow so our dasher couldn‚Äôt pick it up on time. We tipped him extra for this but we were missing 2 shakes. He told us the restaurant said we didn‚Äôt order them even though he had them shown on the order and we paid for them. He told us to contact DoorDash for a refund and we did. Instead of refunding it they gave it to us as ‚Äúcredit.‚Äù We couldn‚Äôt speak to anyone and they didn‚Äôt give us any other option. We didn‚Äôt want to order from them again especially with how high the fees are. $12 won‚Äôt even cover the fees.

I‚Äôm essentially not getting the food I paid for. Another issue I see often, is when my driver is delivering my food the time will change from 25min to well over 60min because they stopped at another home on the way.

They look at me and said yes. It was cancelled by DoorDash.  

Call DoorDash customer support, and they say it was cancelled because the driver couldn‚Äôt find me. I now know that this is 100% a DoorDash issue. The dashers apparently get paid for the pickups. So it appears they don‚Äôt want to pick up 15 pound dog food bags when they can drive through and pick up a Sammie.

Customers tip big in hopes that their food will get there efficiently, turns out 4 drivers declined it before the food finally got picked up because they thought they were getting no tip, then it‚Äôs cold by the time it gets there. Or customers tip big because they live far from the restaurant, and the same thing happens.

So I contact support. Support tells me, ‚Äúsorry there is nothing we can do and we can‚Äôt refund your money.‚Äù Why? Because the app didn‚Äôt work I have to just let go of almost 25 dollars? I asked to speak with a supervisor and I was told they would call me at some point that day and THEY NEVER CALLED. Now I tried to order from Arby‚Äôs and it‚Äôs been almost 30 minutes and the order hasn‚Äôt even been confirmed yet. Very displeased with door dash and their customer service.

They stated they knocked multiple times and texted. When I explained I was sitting out front so there was no way they were at my house, they got extremely rude. I asked if nobody answered the door after you knocked multiple times then what did you do with the food? I asked this question several times but they danced around it and never said.

One time I was charged $5 that just said etc. On the receipt, what was this $5?!?! It was none of my food because they all showed up already. And I never tip in app because door dash takes a percentage of that from the drivers, I just give them a tip when they show up.

I have asked Dashers to call if they cannot find my apartment and rarely get a call. I‚Äôve had some flawless deliveries, but have also had a dasher deliver to a complex a mile away from me. I‚Äôm very disappointed and hate that if I‚Äôm having a hard day and need to order my food, I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôll even show up.

Example: Today, my Dasher didn‚Äôt check to make sure they were delivering the right thing. I ordered from McDonalds a quarter pounder meal and a cheeseburger ‚Äî I got 3 large fries.

A couple weeks ago my order arrived cold because my Dasher (and this is allowed by DoorDash) took another order while working on mine. So after picking up my order at the restaurant, they stopped at a different restaurant and waited for that order, then delivered the other order first.

I understand that mistakes happen (maybe an item or two is missing from the order), but come on, there should be some sort of guarantee that DoorDash will fix or fully refund wrong orders ‚Äî they don‚Äôt.

It was fast food with French fries, meat and such and about a $20 order on which I had ahead of time added a $5 tip. 
The only option was to cancel the order which made me pay anyways as the app has no contact to DoorDash or phone number even. 
I called the restaurant who was very nice and offered that there was a number listed not on the app. 
I called and got someone hard to understand. He  told me I had to pay anyways and that they could not re-issue the order. But that had I called them first (again no number in app) that then they could‚Äôve done something or if I waited for the old food to arrive then I could have had them re-issue it. Clearly you could see all the times on that end as I receive text messages on everything. 
After I discussed it with him for a few minutes he agreed to at least refund the five dollar tip since the driver never delivered. I told him I didn‚Äôt necessarily even need a refund I just wanted the food delivered fresh or a credit for another time but he said I would have to place another order and pay again!

The good.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
They have a large selection of restaurants that other apps my family has tried do not deliver.

If they complete the delivery properly (more on that later) they rarely ever mess up the order.

You are able to get refunds.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Now the bad
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Where to start.

Most of the time we ordered from this app the food was extremely late and cold, the reason being was that the delivery driver had 4 deliveries. By extremely late, I mean up to 5 hours after we ordered and no it‚Äôs not that our order was done last, no they had the food the entire time, and each time we had to call them to speed it up, because one of my family members is diabetic and needs to eat with their medication. 

Their policy on cold food is laughable, each time we had to spend up to a hour talking to them, with each time them giving us either credits or a refund with sometimes only half of what we payed for literally cold food.

Their app has had quite a few issues as well causing things not to be ordered wrong things to be ordered and other things.

In my experience the farther the location from you the most likely the quality of the food wont be as good by time it gets to you. Wish the reviews of each resteraunt was more detailed. They are still a good measuring tool before you order from a particular resteraunt. If you're order is wrong or food is not good customer service will only give you a partial credit depending on the times you complain. I had an order where it was 100% wrong after waiting over an hour an a half that even the delivery person confirmed it and only got a partial credit for my next order.

1967,Quirky App,False,2020-04-13 23:19:45,2,"On several restaurants it forces you to choose things that should be optional or obvious.  A lot of menus are not right. When you order, it‚Äôs not clear whether you are double charged or not. For example, on Noodles and Co, If you order Beef Stroganoff, which is made with Beef, Beef is a required selection in the protein area, even tho it comes with the meal. And there is a +$3.50 as if you should be charged for what comes standard. That is apart from wanting to add double. 

Group order is cool, but the Group leader can not modify orders or even change the max price point for him/herself. The app sends lots of errors. And if you delete an item because a group member made a mistake, they can‚Äôt start over. Sending a new link doesn‚Äôt work. I am super surprised this app is so technologically quirky.

So, I tried to get help from Door Dash assistance to see if they can help.  After a while of waiting and of them calling BJ‚Äôs, they simply told me to place the order manually.  I brought up the red card, and from my understanding, they were telling me that I could use it.

Except it got declined, repeatedly.

I got help from a different Door Dash Assistant to see what was going on, and apparently I can‚Äôt use it because it was ‚Äúalready paid for.‚Äù  I decided to let the customer know about the issues because I figured it would be rude to just leave them out of the loop.

When I asked assistance if there was anything that could be done and mentioned that I let the customer know about this, they left me hanging.  They even let the chat session time out, closing me out of the chat.  

From bad advice to suddenly no advice, it left me feeling kind of abandoned.

I got to deliver the order anyway, but needless to say I was not impressed with how my own employer handled the situation.  Their assistance basically amounted to the equivalent of ‚Äúnone whatsoever.‚Äù",Affinite1,

So now I‚Äôm stuck with a bunch of food that I can‚Äôt eat, because of an allergy, short $20 which is way too much considering I could‚Äôve gotten my order for $8.50 if I went and got it myself, and now I‚Äôve lost even more work time for today trying to get this all straightened out than I would have if I had just gone out and gotten the food myself.",ApriilRose,
1996,The worst thing to happen to Millennials,False,2021-02-20 00:32:29,1,"By making it convenient and streamlining delivery, this app has figured out how to separate unconscientious young adults from their money. By having the ability to summon a stranger from the internet to bring food from a plethora of restaurants to your doorstep, DD has figured out how to monetize laziness. Why cook, when a stranger can bring you food from anywhere! Look at how accessible it is! 

Meanwhile, often times the fees and markup add up to more than an entree price, and more times than not, the food is delivered cold. Cold, overpriced slop. In all honesty you could totally feed a single adult for an ENTIRE WEEK off of what it costs to have 1-2 meals delivered by doordash‚Äôs independent contractors. 

On to the contractors. Doordash has figured out how to get people to work, and assume ALL OF RISK for their company in terms of day-to-day services, while being compensated sometimes as little as 7 dollars an hour. 7 bucks an hour to maintain, fuel, and insure a vehicle, stand in lines, deliver meals to people who complain about their pizza being late who also fell victim to the doordash business model. 

I‚Äôd call and complain but they outsource their customer service to a call center overseas. Nicest people, but outsourced labor. I‚Äôd wager that Doordash in the outsourcing business, instead of the service industry. Labor, support, probably even development.",Cubes19,

Also can‚Äôt really rate on the drivers either. Just like other reviews, If you order a drink, good luck and if you leave a side note to let them know ‚Äúplease knock on the door/hand it to me.‚Äù Good luck cuz some leave it and disappear I feel like a stalker making sure they actually hand it to me or give me the drink I ordered.

And this may be the fault of the restaurant, but many of them, not all but many, are now blocking customizations so we have to call them, and sometimes it is too late.

I have never had any wrong situations with any dashers and i am always respectful but because I actually notified them of my order constantly being wrong or me never even receiving it I was flagged.

2007,Reliability Terrible and Door Dash Customer Service Even worse,False,2020-01-03 14:19:24,1,"I have been a Door Dash Patron for years; there have been hiccups in service, but that‚Äôs
to be occasionally expected given the nature of the business. Mostly recently, I placed
an order for myself, my girlfriend, and her friend, and we didn‚Äôt receive notification until an hour an 15 minutes later that the order had been cancelled. On my Door Dash interface, it had
shown that the delivery was 0-2 mins away only to find out that it had been cancelled. Unacceptable? Unprofessional? Take your pick. As a result, I had no food (this was New Year‚Äôs day) and I lost out on $300 as tickets had been purchased for a New Year‚Äôs event. Door dash customer support exchanged half a dozen emails with me and was exceedingly difficult to reach by phone; in the end, I was credited with $20 to my account. Between myself, my girlfriend, and her friend, we spend thousand of dollars using door dash services a year. $20 was a slap in the face. The decision to switch patronage to other food delivery services couldn‚Äôt have been easier. 

Door Dash provides a product and service that is shameful; if I were an employee, I would be embarrassed to say I work for them. Being a small business owner myself with an MBA, the way Door Dash conducts business is borderline unethical. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR ‚Äî HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM.

Plus the frustration sobered me up so there went any fun I was having. 

This doesn‚Äôt include the multiple times where the actual delivery of my meal took 2+ hours to drive 7miles. When I order fried chicken at 6pm and it doesn‚Äôt come until 1am....that‚Äôs a F‚Äôn problem. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about restaurants cancelling your order.

Our last and final delivery took 1hr30min for some already made cookies (seriously try drinking and eating) again 7 miles away. Thankfully I‚Äôll eat old cookies over chicken sitting at room temp for hours upon hours.

2026,Poor Communication and Follow Through,False,2021-01-30 01:21:27,1,"I‚Äôve had two poor experiences with Door Dash twice this week.

First experience- I placed an order that the Dasher canceled due to ‚Äúproduct being out of stock.‚Äù It was coffee from Dunkin Donuts, and the order was made at 9:30AM. I find it hard to believe Dunkin was out of black coffee...

Rather than contact me directly to inform of the issue and my options, the Dasher just canceled it.  I only was made aware of the cancellation upon receiving an email update. I contacted customer support and they could not offer any reason as to why the Dasher has the power to do this, without informing the customer. 

Second Experience- my husband placed an order on the App. Immediately, a pending charge showed up in his account (no confirmation # provided) however the app order history showed no record of an order being placed. He did not receive an email or text confirmation either. After uninstalling and reinstalling the app with no success,  I called customer service and spoke with a representative who could not offer any insight as to why the order wasn‚Äôt showing up but assured us it was on its way. We are still waiting for our food to arrive. 

A company that demonstrates lack luster customer service, ambiguity in their policies, and poor communication makes me uncomfortable. I do not plan to utilize DoorDash again.",dnaoworkfkzkkwkwmwmwmwajsnd,

There are times when the  DoorDash app crashes for hours or   Some merchants will simply not double check sometimes they would forget an item or they won‚Äôt have the item and not say a thing to the drivers I feel like if there‚Äôs communication I think every customer would be satisfied with DoorDash service butI do recommend them than other delivery services since the other ones are very expensive .,enoriega623,

Not only was there no Dash her, but they took down the app and the website so you had no way of knowing the status of your order, or a person you could talk to to find out more. They did refund us our money and gave us a credit towards your next order. We decided to do it again tonight. We made our order which was received properly by the pizza place.

I explained to the driver that I put specific instructions in my delivery notes for just such occasions, but I believe there was a language barrier. Perhaps drivers should make a better effort to read those notes and not get frustrated at the customer because they fail to thoroughly read instructions. We had to cancel our order and reorder because we either didn‚Äôt know if he was coming, or if he did, by the time he got here, our food would undoubtedly be cold.

So all of our time was wasted, and when I went to cancel the order (because the Dasher needed me to do that so she can accept future orders) it said I can't be refunded since the order wasn't being prepared. But the order WASN'T being prepared, because the restaurant doesn't even have a way to accept DoorDash orders.

Unfortunately, door dash became literally unbearable and impossible to use due to unreasonable prolonged delivery times, absolutely awful customer service, and next to no problem resolution. They have gradually gotten worse, and as loyal as I was, I felt left with no other option than to cancel my membership, delete the app, and switch to postmates. And I‚Äôm yet to have any issues with them.

The most frustrating part was that, when a problem occurred and I felt it was the tip of the iceberg, I reached out to their customer service team expressing my deep frustration and clearly laying out the list of issues I‚Äôve had with them this year; the only response I was given seemed to be an automatic email reply that offered me a measly refund on a recent order. No sympathy whatsoever. Simply didn‚Äôt seem interested in retaining my business.

Trust me on this, Post mates is the superior app, all around.

The second issue was support. There is no way to contact support directly from the app for canceled  orders. I had to call them. When I did, I would get conflicting or just plain false information. The wait time for chat and phone support was also way too long. If your going to hire overseas support anyways, hire more of them to reduce the wait time.

Also, many drivers call or indicate on the app that they are approaching 5+ minutes before they are anywhere near approaching. Almost all drivers do both of these things. What is the problem? 

I highly recommend giving the customer an option on the app to adjust the tip amount after the delivery is completed like Uber Eats does. Doing this, without a question, would give drivers the incentive to provide much more genuine service.",Important review critic,

The selection here vs GrubHub (another ripoff alternative) is also terrible and I‚Äôm sure these struggling Rs can‚Äôt join the mobster like shakedown from GH & DD so they choose one or the other & DD is losing.

 I asked my neighbor if he saw anything  he said no, and told me that I should not order from DoorDash. And I am done with DoorDash.

I see people are having a weird issue with the ‚Äútip‚Äù word because a tip would be after the service. If doordash changed the word to maybe ‚ÄúBid‚Äù they will comprehend how doordash works.

So one hour after order in a very hangry state, I‚Äôve replaced my order and am waiting to see what happens this time.

Pickup is the way to go, as there is usually a small discount and you have the control over when you get your food (Plus you save on tipping, although tipping isn‚Äôt required with delivery, it‚Äôs become the culture, and unfortunately dashers really do rely on decent tips to make a living wage).

That being said, I think there are issues with the app itself as well as the pricing. Because of delivery fees, a meal that costs $10 jumps up to $25 or more, which I think is a result of the company being greedy and wanting to squeeze as much profit out of it as possible. I think if theyre going to charge so much, they should pay the drivers more instead. It‚Äôs also so frustrating when I pay so much to have food delivered at a certain time, and then I receive a notification saying the driver is picking up another order so mine will be delivered 30 minutes later than anticipated.

So let‚Äôs say if a driver receive the order with a guaranteed pay of $5, if the customer pay a $3 tip, then the driver gets paid $5. If the customer pay a $6 tip, then the driver will get $6. Basically whatever you pay in app for tip is used to cover the company expenses (which is to pay the driver) first.

The wait time estimations are sometimes wildly inaccurate as well. As I'm writing this right now the app has bounced from 50 minutes to 20 minutes back up to 66 minutes. The wait times can be wildly inaccurate so make sure you have the time to order.",PamDeller,

I‚Äôve used Doordash many times now, and not once have I ever had a rude delivery driver, or a wrong order which is incredibly lovely because I never regret my purchase. The only reason why I give a 4/5, is because you choose a tip amount before you actually meet your driver, which I think is kind of unfair because I‚Äôm the kind of person to determine my tip based on the professionalism and attitude of the delivery person.

I travel for work and have been forced to have food delivered to hotels thanks to the pandemic.  While this app works well I have some major issues w/ it. 

- Tipping before delivery is not how it should be.  The tip should come after delivery and you‚Äôre satisfied w/ it.  Had to many bad deliveries where they did not follow instructions, got lost along the way or refused to drop at door. 

- Combined deliveries.  This ties into tipping. Your timeframe can increase dramatically when the driver stops at multiple places before they get to you.  You should be informed of this up front. 

- Lack of descriptions.  Assuming the restaurant sets this part up.  Lack of details leads to no order.  This is especially prevalent w/ foreign cuisines.  But even standard American far lacks details.  I want to know what‚Äôs on it so I can tell them what not to put on it. 

The tipping structure and cost has led me to tip the lowest possible amount every time.  This only hurts the drivers.  It‚Äôs saved me a good bit of money at their expense.  If it wasn‚Äôt for the convoluted process of getting a tip refund I would go through it more often.  Really need to make it tip after delivery.  At least give the option of changing it.",dragon813gt,

It should be set up just like the other driving services. Once the service has been provided you can give a tip based on your satisfaction with the service you received.,Morgannicole252,

Also, I put in driver instructions once for a restaurant that didn‚Äôt have specific options for drinks and now it shows up no matter where I order from, even if I haven‚Äôt ordered a drink.

I check the app to find out our driver had changed? 20 minutes after the expected delivery time (25-35 mins) I decided to call our new delivery driver and ask how long it was going to take. I called her a couple times with no answer. Finally she called back and I said I ordered delivery through door dash and she hung up on me! We decided to cancel our order and just head to the restaurant. After talking to the staff she showed up to pick up the order and was very rude asking when the food was going to be ready. They said about 4 minutes and she left! They had our food ready to go when we got there and let us take it home for free since it would‚Äôve been thrown out anyways. I suggest you look at different more reliable ways of food delivery before you use this app. There is also no way to report the dashers,http.uhg,

She didn‚Äôt think to first of all see the name on the order because I‚Äôm not just some guy my name was clear on that order, there were even directions to call.

Finally I got a new driver who said he just got assigned my order and was going to pick it up in 10 minutes.  After picking it up it would take another 10 min to get to me.  My issues is I understand things happen but DoorDash policy is if something goes wrong with the pick up they get another driver which means in my case the food would be very cold since it was ready 30-45 prior.   They didn‚Äôt contact me to see if I still wanted the order.  Instead they were going to send cold food and hope I take it.

2190,"Late, cold, and wrong. Rarely ever satisfying.",False,2019-03-04 00:22:25,1,"DoorDash rarely gets it right, and they don‚Äôt seem to care. 

We‚Äôve been trying DoorDash for about the last two or three months. Our family runs a restaurant locally, so we understand that in spite of your best intentions, sometimes things go wrong. Thus, we‚Äôve tried to give DoorDash plenty of opportunities to get it right. Unfortunately, they just keep getting it wrong. 

Out of the last ten orders, eight of them have arrived very late (30-60 minutes longer than the *promised* time), very wrong (wrong toppings, missing items, or even the wrong dish altogether), and/or very cold (one dasher delivered our food on a cold night riding a bicycle!). 

The first time we found the order to be wrong, we contacted the driver, who said something along the lines of ‚Äúnothing I can do about that, man, I‚Äôm just a driver. You gotta call DoorDash or something.‚Äù  We‚Äôve since learned that there isn‚Äôt a number to call. Your only recourse is to leave a bad comment via the in-app feedback system. All DoorDash does is credit you a few dollars towards your next order.  I‚Äôm not sure what the exact formula is, but it seems to be running about 10-15% of the total order. And what if the meal is either missing half the items or so wrong we can‚Äôt even eat it?  Too darned bad, it seems. We‚Äôre just out the money (and still hungry).

This is how they do it - cause they say all of your tip goes to the drivers right?  They pay the drivers a basic delivery payment and whenever there is a tip through the app Door Dash Inc reduces that delivery payment to the driver by that amount (up to and including $5) - then they get to say 100% of your tip goes to the driver (by misleading us, their customers).  Of course I‚Äôm thinking my tip was above and beyond the delivery payment - nope.  This purposeful misleading of me, the customer about my tip pisses me off!

So if you use Door Dash, do not tip in the app - Door Dash keeps it - give the driver cash.

Second issue, tip before any service is provided. I only tip the minimum due to the requirement of tipping before you place the order. I haven‚Äôt received any service so why would I tip?! If I could tip after like the Uber app I would tip according. I currently give the driver cash if they are good and fast but would rather do it through the app.

This comes from how I always give like a nice tip, I consider distance and how much they carry and such of that matter. BUT extra award for really great service is sometimes a feature I wish I could utilize. Or the fact that this man brought my food today and his little boy was with him and was carrying the red insulated bag ü•∫ instantly wanted to give them $5 more for being precious lol. 

Anyway, some dashers really go above and beyond, giving wonderful updates, working with requests, kind messages with their drop off‚Äôs, and so forth. So I think the ability to go back to the order and add more tip would be really cool :)

I ordered from dairy queen, my order has ice cream in it. the order estimate said 5:30. then got a notification that my driver was dropping off 2 other orders, moved to 5:50. not to big of a deal i guess, ice cream will be melted but what can you do. it‚Äôs now 5:53 and my dasher has just made it to the first house, and has been sitting in their neighborhood for probably 10 mins. estimate is now not until 6:20. not only will my ice cream be melted but the food cold. 
how does an estimate go from 5:30 to 6:20? doordash needs to limit orders to 2 at a time, i should not have to wait for 2 other people to get their orders, and have the dasher sit and wait for i presume someone to come out and grab their order. had this problem before and the food was cold.

When you realize your order is not moving/no progress and try to contact support, all the app give you is instructions that doesn‚Äôt even work. 
NOT TO MENTION: they website is also down...
What to expect from that?!
A super nice app that you can‚Äôt chat with a real person or get a customer service rep phone number?! 
For real.....

Now leaving the app review aside, 
I don‚Äôt know if there can be good experiences with this company, but I haven‚Äôt... they re-timed my schedule 3 times... original delivery was 58 minutes, after having 2 changes of time we called the restaurant and we know the owner, she said ‚ÄúSorry hon, we are canceling DoorDash after this because is the 5 time we cook the food and they never show up!‚Äù
HA!!! Imagine that!

The app has gotten the driver confused with the orders and had to drive to four different locations which took about 3 hours to complete. I had to wait until 8:30-9:00 to finally get my order, I requested by order at 6:00. I called my driver and she said the people that were ordering had the wrong address, took her another hour to get to the right address, causing more setbacks for her as she had 3 more orders to complete.

I only wanted something from Wendy‚Äôs that‚Äôs all. I was patient and waited another 30 minutes. But this lady had to go to the gas station as well because she was running low on gas. My thing is why did you waited long enough to do that? Why didn‚Äôt you go to the station long before completing these orders?

Customer service was okay.... but they need to be more descriptive and let me know on my end about the order instead of giving me one explanation. The driver told me the full story which made me understand more of the issue.

The app doesn‚Äôt specify certain things making it hard for the driver to understand what exactly the order is and instead of calling you they guess and your order ends up missing things and or being wrong. Thirdly, the price is outlandish compared to other ordering services... roughly $10 more for taxes and fees and delivery charges. Lastly, (and the final straw for me) why would you have restaurants listed with menu items if they don‚Äôt accept door dash?

Does anyone find it pointless and in my case, infuriating that DoorDash has an option to pickup yourself?

I would think if you ordered an Uber that you would expect a car to arrive and not find out that they expected you to drive yourself. But that wouldn‚Äôt happen because Uber doesn‚Äôt have that icon as they are a ride share company. 

The fact that I‚Äôm now out $45 because I‚Äôm an idiot and didn‚Äôt even think that this pickup option was in fact an option, is ridiculous. My understanding was that DoorDash picks up your order and delivers it to you. That‚Äôs the whole point in DoorDash right?!

However, the last time I used the app I waited almost 30 minutes just for a dasher to be assigned to my order. Then I contacted customer support through the app, but the conversation totally disappeared when I switched to text messages and back. Then, after waiting *longer* to see if a dasher had been assigned, I cancelled like I always had, assuming there was a bug. But this time apparently I don‚Äôt get any refund!

Our fifth order never arrived because the restaurant refused to make the order because prior delivery drivers never showed up and they lost $100 in food.

To see it in my credit card or bank charge of the wrong amount and having to go back and remember all the items that were not delivered that day can be quite a hassle... It's suppose to be hassle free... That's why I didn't go grab it personally to begin with...  I will have to go back to traditionally calling to order and picking it up.  No more food delivery...

I ordered from the Popular Items section an item simply titled ‚ÄúCheese‚Äù with no description, just an option to chose a size. I assumed this was a cheese pizza. Nope, when it arrived it was a large cheese calzone. Similar situation when we ordered from a Thai restaurant. No noodle or curry dish had a description or option for a protein. Every dish was vegetarian unless you write in a protein. These lack of options and descriptions seem common across the app. No competitor has such a lack of details.

Literally the exact same thing happened. 30 mins later and the dasher had not left his home even for the pick up - this time he would not respond to texts or phone calls. And guess what, when a driver has already been assigned (even if they aren‚Äôt even attempting to pick up your food), you cannot cancel without calling their customer service.

I started getting a lot of questions about how the app works so I tested it out for myself. The app itself is very self explanatory, and easy to use as well as understand. Delivery is not for everyone. You will get those drivers that have no sense of direction or those that just don‚Äôt want to follow simple instructions.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the people who work for the UberEats vs DoorDash but it‚Äôs a MAJOR difference. With UberEats everytime it was a 50/50 chance the person would call me trying to find my place with one person they didn‚Äôt even try they just parked and were sitting in their car calling me and I had to walk up to them to get my food. After using DoorDash for months now every single time there has never been any issue and they are quick to find my place and never bother me.

2309,Convenient but Aggravating,False,2020-05-14 18:53:32,5,"It‚Äôs great to be able to order food for delivery from virtually anywhere, but its aggravating for a few reasons:

1. Restaurants barely ever have their full menu, or even drink selections on the app.
2. Combos are hard because they ask unnecessary questions but leave out important questions
3. If a restaurant is out of something they just give you anything. Drivers are supposed to call before leaving to make sure you want that item but never do.
4. If you live close by you can‚Äôt return the food to the actual restaurant and get it replaced with what you actually ordered even if you have a receipt.
5. If you complain because food was missing, or they gave you the wrong item more than once or twice they ban you from using the app, or complaining again... even if this happens every time you order. 

These problems exists in all of the apps. But it‚Äôs easier to talk to doordash directly and have certain issues fixed. So I would still choose doordash over all the others If I HAD TO use a delivery service, like now.",Desnacia,

Once again we didn‚Äôt get our food after hours of trying to communicate with them on our end and trying to get information.

The price to get food delivered has also gone up. More often than not the food is cold. This is because the restaurant made the food and sits and waits for a driver to pick it up which can take a while.

The convince is nice but getting beyond justifiable. 1 item alone had an almost $4 markup vs the restaurants website. 

 Add onto that, when I placed an order the dasher has to make multiple stops and passes the closest to go to the farthest makes absolutely no sense.

The amount of times my dasher ‚Äúbreaks down‚Äù when I order $100+ worth of food from a nice restaurant as I watch them drive right to their house on the app because it doesn‚Äôt stop tracking them until the customer service representative cancels the order. Today alone both of my orders estimated 1 hour and took a few closer to two. You have to pay a tip prior to delivery, unlike other competitors, which isn‚Äôt a big deal until you tip big and get bad service repeatedly. I‚Äôve stopped paying for DashPass and plan to switch back to Postmates or UberEats as the low quality of service seems to be the normal now.",zcozadd,

I tried Uber Eats but it didn‚Äôt work at all after downloading it and re-downloading it many times on my relatively new iPhone 11.  DoorDash worked fine, they have a good selection, delivery prices are reasonable (leaving room for a better tip for your delivery driver), and their delivery service was great.  One tip, if you live off the beaten path or it is difficult to see your street address on your mailbox, then watch the delivery driver on the map to make sure he finds your house ok.  If he is having trouble, the DoorDash app conveniently allows you to call your delivery driver and guide him to your house which is no problem to me.

2341,Good service when the order actually gets delivered.,False,2021-03-26 06:28:51,3,"This app can be good, the delivery fees are, most of the time, pretty low, sometimes even free depending on the promo or the restaurants you order from. However, my bad experiences come from ordering food late at nights. 

The other week, I placed an order for a restaurant at 10 pm, and they didn‚Äôt close until 12am midnight. Estimated arrival time was between 10:30 and 10:45. Every half hour the arrival time kept increasing. Multiple dashers refused my request, and by the time the restaurant closed, I wasn‚Äôt notified that my order was canceled until 45 minutes AFTER they closed.

 Another time after that, I placed an order earlier before leaving work to avoid the same issue, and it took almost 2 hours for me to receive my meal. Customer support is helpful and issued refunds when I‚Äôve asked, but with my schedule, most of the time I can‚Äôt eat dinner until late at night, and these issues have happened several times. 

If you can, avoid ordering after 10 pm and just drive to get your food and you‚Äôll more than likely get it before door dash even would‚Äôve begin to head to pick it up, and it‚Äôll be much cheaper.",Ryannn45,

This can make meals up to 2-3 times as much as they would‚Äôve if you had gotten it yourself. It‚Äôs expected to have some fees and to tip the Dasher, but the prices are outrageous! Not only this, but the app constantly glitches, and that makes it difficult to fulfill your order. I was having problems with a recent order because I could not access my old number and my email wasn‚Äôt working, and after a 15 minute customer help call, they told me they couldn‚Äôt help me with my issue.

Our kids are now hungry and cranky and so are we. This is mostly frustrating because doordash requires you to pay a tip to your dasher on top of the delivery fee.

2350,**** this app,False,2020-06-20 05:27:08,1,"I‚Äôm deleting this app after I post this review. Why? Let me count the reasons

1) delivery prices are consistently higher than elsewhere

2) when dashers couldn‚Äôt find my address they kept leaving my food at someone else‚Äôs door. This was before lockdown when my preferred method of delivery was to meet them at the door. No call. No text. Just dropped it and left

3) that one time when my dasher not only dropped my bag of food at my doorstep and ran at the sound of my roommate‚Äôs 1 foot tall dog, I‚Äôm 90% certain she ate my chips

4) I consistently get more orders with missing/mixed up items from DD than elsewhere. Like earlier today. Ordered a combo, a shake, and cheese sticks. Got the wrong size sandwich, the wrong kind of shake, and the fries from the combo and cheese sticks were missing. The only thing they managed to get right was my request for extra ketchup. Which is absolutely pathetic

5) for my trouble with the order I just mentioned, I‚Äôm still out 10 bucks. They would not give me a full refund. Or at least I‚Äôd need to talk to someone over the phone to get a full refund and it was late and I am tired. 

TLDR: use postmates or something instead because DD has garbage service and costs entirely too much.

However: when it doesn‚Äôt work as it should it‚Äôs customer service is an absolute disappointment.

I‚Äôve spent easily a grand using this service over the course of a year. I assumed that as a faithful customer I‚Äôd get rewarded. However, when orders go wrong you‚Äôll only ever get the cost of the food items  reimbursed to you. This evening, I placed an order and 80% of the items were missing. I opened a claim and received a credit for the missing food. But when I went to reorder, I repaid the taxes, fees and had to tip the driver again. It cost me an additional $10 to reorder issuing a credit for food that I ALREADY paid for and had had delivered, fees and taxes paid and driver tipped. 

When I complained to customer service I got nothing - just a lady stating that she couldn‚Äôt find my order and then trying to condescendingly explain how their service works. 

Use UberEats instead - drivers get tipped AFTER you get your food and not before and customer service goes above and beyond.

Delivery often arrives earlier than the estimated time especially if the restaurant is in the vicinity. App experience is delightful most of the times. The in-app chat support is useful too. 

However, things could improve further. 

1. Food prices have a markup on them that is not disclosed (at least prominently). I don't mind the delivery fees, that is of course how they make money. But the practice of marking up prices without a clear indication is a bit shady. Recent addition of ‚Äúlocal response fees‚Äù also goes to show that they‚Äôd rather pass on the fees to consumer. 

2. When it comes to food, most people rarely want a substitute chosen by the restaurant. Why is then that the default option for unavailable items? It is so inconvenient. 

3. When the restaurant calls to let you know of unavailable items, it should be really easy for the restaurant or the customer to remove those items from the order (even if the order is placed). Shouldn't need to contact support (even thought the support is pretty good).

Doordash shouldn‚Äôt be putting a fee on customers for paying benefits to their employees. Customers should definitely pay a delivery fee and it should be set like $5 max. There‚Äôs so many people using this app that it‚Äôs crazy.

I had ordered a simple combo of wings, fries, and a drink, and was expecting someone named ‚ÄúGerald‚Äù. The order was delivered on time, however, it was by a woman. That was no big deal to me, people name their kids crazier things, so I brushed it off to go enjoy my food.

Upon opening the bag, I noticed there was no drink. Again, a simple mistake, and I quickly called the driver back. 

A man answered (totally different/deep/growly voice from the woman who gave me my food). I almost thought I had the wrong number, but then explained to him my situation. He then simply said, nearly cutting me off mid sentence ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt give me a drink‚Äù, quite coldly. A long moment of awkward silence then came, and I just simply said ‚Äúalright, thanks‚Äù and hung up.

So, not only was I missing a third of my order, but I have absolutely NO IDEA who the mystery woman was that delivered my food, no idea who the mystery grumpy man was that answered my call, no idea who I tipped, and no idea where my drink went.

The woman on the line was very nice, no problem there. She informed me that the package was in transit and I could track it through USPS, which I was already doing and was viewing as we spoke... USPS tracking said the package was still in pre-shipment, not in transit. But, I trusted the helpful employee who told me if it was in transit, I should expect it within the next 4 days.

4 days pass, still no kit. So I wait a few more, still nothing. I call customer service again and explain this ridiculous situation, and after concluding that I had literally tried everything, I was told to go to the local office an hour away from me and pick it up there.

CONVENIENTLY to my surprise, when I arrive, there is a notice on the door from the day prior that the office was closed due to a power outage.

I‚Äôve wasted so much time and money using doordash that I can‚Äôt get back and it‚Äôs really upsetting. I might as well go back to postmates. Doordash customer service has been nothing but a nightmare any time I‚Äôve had problems not receiving all or parts of my orders. It‚Äôs taken over a year of horrible experiences using door dash to finally write this out. But my experience with door dash has been worse than falling for an MLM scam.

First of all the prices of the menu items are more expensive than they are at the actual restaurant so they are making money on you just on the food you order and then they charge you a ridiculous fee just for using door dash. Then some restaurants want a service fee which is understandable and then a tip on top of that. These drivers deserve tips but between all these extra fees and inflated prices of food they are scamming people. What should have been a 32$ meal I ended up paying 49$ for.

Pretty important for choosing delivery because not all food travels well and the farther it is the less fresh its going to be when you get it. For example I ordered from Popeyes Chicken and instead of coming from one of the two places within a few miles of me, it was delivered from one way across town.

3 hours later I never received the order. After multiple chat conversations with DoorDash, as well as a phone call, they continually denied any knowledge of the order or the ability to lookup information about it.

The manager even duped to claiming that the automated text updates were not from them.

This has by far been the worst customer experience I've ever had.

Thankfully the local restaurant was incredibly helpful, and re-made my order (which I drove to pickup).

I work at potbelly Sandwich Shop which recently started door dash and only 1 outa of 11 drivers brought their bags in with them.. which I then would tell them to get the bag cause I refuse to hand food out when they don‚Äôt have the proper heat sourced bag.. here‚Äôs my question.. is there a way to have the drivers show proof they are using the bags!

I also think that after a certain amount of deliveries dashers should be rewarded to make us go even harder and ever further. Lyft offers amazing rewards for gas and other things. DoorDash should at least offer free food or something if a dasher does 10 deliveries or something. That way we‚Äôre encouraged to DoorDash. But I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just dasher from Jersey.",Zarien,

2592,FOOD NEVER ARRIVED,False,2020-03-12 22:09:53,1,my boyfriend and I tried to give door dash the benefit of doubt when the first time we used the app our food never arrived and we couldn‚Äôt track our driver. We attempted to use this service 3 more times and each of those times we still didn‚Äôt receive our food and we couldn‚Äôt track or get in contact with the driver. We would check the map as it says arriving in 1 minute only to go outside and have no one show up and the app frozen on delivery in 1 minute. Driver and food no where to be seen. Each time we called customer service there response was we can‚Äôt locate your driver but we will refund your order. Even though we were lucky enough to have been refunded it‚Äôs still frustrating to have an app and team that can‚Äôt control or manage the drivers better being unable to find one of the independent workers is an issue considering it‚Äôs a waste of customers time hunger and money.,disappointed-user-,

This product is an absolute joke given how desperate it needs to be to compete against so many other apps doing the exact same thing. What kind of company has downtime as frequent as doordash? How silly is it that doordash is the only one out of the bunch that never fails to disappoint?

She also lied when I called back to DoorDash customer service saying she was waiting for 15 min. Very unfortunate.

One customer service agent said they could not provide a refund for my order because ‚Äútheir system won‚Äôt allow it‚Äù. I guess the ‚ÄúDoorDash system‚Äù allows them to take money without providing services, but won‚Äôt allow them them to refund an incomplete order.

However with Postmates an actual driver goes into the restaurant and places the order and can call the customer to explain any irregularities in the order.

You pay more for the food than on the restaurants website and more fees to have your food ordered from a restaurant that‚Äôs not even close to where you live.

2664,Dashers Can't Navigate,False,2018-10-29 18:45:53,2,"I was just going to ignore this but when EVERY single dasher does it--I have to tell people.
It might be a product of our poorly educated and mind-numbing culture, but Dashers can't navigate with their own brains. My house number is clearly posted on the outside of my house but every time a dasher tells me ""they're outside my house"" they are actually 1) waiting in their car down the street 2) a few houses down because they just rely on GPS instead of using their EYES and LOOKING at the house number. Then, they waltz up with that ""I hate the system so I'm going to take it out on a young woman ordering delivery"" attitude and hand over the food.
BTW, I work in food service so I am not that uppity privileged ""customer"" you're thinking of--sorry to disappoint. 
Also, the app has failed to update twice in the past month I've been using Doordash; it will stick on ""preparing order"" when my dasher is ""approaching"" (i.e. waiting in their car down the street).
I've never had these experiences when it was just calling to order a pizza. Delivery people could make it to the doorstep without a phone call and me to hold their hand.

2667,App vs execution,False,2018-07-18 00:30:57,3,"I use Door Dash fairly regularly over the last 2-3 months now. The app is easy to use with a clean design and friendly UX. The issues come from the content of the app being up-to-date or notated. 

The app allows some order items to be noted with special instruction- to modify an order, specify a flavor, or whatnot. 

I order from my local sushi restaurant most often and get a dessert (almost every time) that offers two individual flavors out of a possible four. That item cannot have any special instructions left on it.

Which means EVERY TIME I order I get phone calls asking which flavors I would like. Every time I tell them that the app does not permit a note. Occasionally I am told they will fix it. Add on to that the calls from the delivery drivers because my driveway is easily missed (understandable) and the occasional post-delivery ‚Äúhow was your service‚Äù call and there could be 2-4 calls per order. 

I have had a couple of orders cancelled or incorrect. 

Some improvements definitely are needed. Overall, I get delivery where I would normally not be able to. So, that rules.

I was owed my regular pay for the week when I noticed it was being deposited like my normal pay was. I reached out to see what was wrong when I was told that my account info was wrong and that they got my payment sent back to them. 

They listed some basic steps I needed to fix it and I was assured that I would be payed ASAP! 

That was in almost 2 months ago!!!!!!

I open a ticket and then DD marks my case as closed and never pays me. I call and am told my case is reopened and that it is being escalated.

2690,Good service but all me to cancel the driver,False,2019-10-23 16:36:10,5,"I love using this app and typically will get lunch through DoorDash for the convenience. 

The BIGGEST annoyance with this service is not being able to cancel a driver who is literally taking their sweet time. I‚Äôve ordered items from places that are only 5-10 minutes away that took an HOUR because the driver sat in a parking lot or drove to the completely opposite side of the city - usually the app will say if they‚Äôre delivering another order and this isn‚Äôt the case. 

PLEASE allow the user to find a new driver or automatically offer the delivery to someone else if too much time passes and the location of the driver to the food pick up is inconsistent.",FoodGuyDude,

The instructions are rarely followed and 80% of the time I have to talk them through it over the phone as they arrive.

This is an app problem because although I put the instructions in the order details, the driver doesn‚Äôt see the instructions until after they have arrived at the location, and they usually don‚Äôt look back at the app after arriving. 

If the Door Dash team could make the special delivery instructions available to the driver *before* they arrive at the location, that would probably help.",gawg-Michigan,

First I order from a restaurant and after half an hour they let me know that part of my order isn‚Äôt available. I can order something else with same price. When I give another choice they don‚Äôt even have that too. I then have to connect to DoorDash support and cancel the order. They initiated the refund but absolutely no apologies for my hassle. Then I start ordering from another restaurant and after 30-40 minuets The dasher arrives... to A Wrong Address! Finally I received my food just now and I am hungry and mad.

They trick users into giving a 15% tip at checkout by automatically selecting it for you instead of letting you choose your own tip. I‚Äôm not sure if they did this because people weren‚Äôt tipping enough, but you still do not tip BEFORE a service is finished. If the driver decides to make a stop at his house or to pick up cigarettes and the cheese on your nachos is hard and lukewarm by the time it gets to you, oops. Too late. Already tipped him. Door dash might refund you but they don‚Äôt take the tips back. Scumbags will take advantage of this until door dash catches on and fires them along to their next scheme.",Bmt1997,

When you do get to contact a rep, they act like it‚Äôs your fault that the driver was late and don‚Äôt want to give you a refund, credits, or even listen to your concerns. All of the reps are completely indifferent btw.

I thought they made their money through their delivery fees, but I suppose not. So after spending over $20 on fast food for 2 people, only two burgers arrived instead of the combos I expected. And that doesn‚Äôt include the tip I left and getting delivery free for the first order. I know they have to make money, but it is misleading to mark up the food cause one would expect more!

Even still, I feel as though as Door Dash continues to grow, they will improve with each coming month. To conclude my review, I must say one last thing.

I contacted customer service and found out that their driver had confirmed my order but never actually went to the restaurant at all. DoorDash offered to place my order again but by this time McDonald‚Äôs was showing as closed. They only offered to give me a credit of what I already paid so that I could place an order with another restaurant. Nothing was done to rectify the unprofessional behavior of their driver.

First they have idiotic people that deliver for them for example one delivery person just dropped off my food to a random person and said it was delivered. Secondly they always process your money immediately so your refund takes about 4-5 days to even process fully and now this last time issue I‚Äôm having is that there are no delivery drivers accepting orders. Like what are the odds of that happening. On top of that they have restaurants posted that aren‚Äôt apart of DoorDash anymore and you won‚Äôt notice until you place an order and it gets canceled immediately after it‚Äôs taken your money.

He acted like he didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt even know which store he came from. I did put in for my credit to my account but never using this app again.

The customer service representative (in different occasions we have talked to two agents and I have all the transcripts saved and even I shared it with them in email for better understanding) seems ignorant about the fact that the app is faulty while applying the promo or able to recognize new customer or not, they kept on blabbering on the same statement like an old radio.

Want to sign up for DashPass to avoid so many fees? Well, don‚Äôt try to use Apple Pay / Apple Card...

When I tried to sign up for DashPass, it said there was a problem with my payment. I spoke to Goldman Sachs (the Apple Card bank) who said they hadn‚Äôt declined the one cent charge (necessary to start the free trial) - ‚Äúthe merchant‚Äù had immediately reversed the transaction.

I chatted with a DoorDash rep for 30+ minutes who kept saying it was my card. While chatting, I placed my food order - including all the fees - and it worked fine, proving the card is ok. I suggested they give me a credit for the fees while we figured out the broader problem and she simply ended the chat. ‚ÄúSorry we couldn‚Äôt help you...  chat ended. 

I‚Äôm convinced they don‚Äôt want to sign one up for DoorPass with all protections and anonymity afforded by Apple Pay / Apple Card.

Now they are stacking orders so drivers are running all around town with your food making several deliveries.  While you have the misfortune of being the last delivery on their list.

I‚Äôve been in customer service for over 20 years, and what I see from DoorDash drivers and their ‚Äúhelp desk‚Äù and app is the worst.  When you complain about your food or the time it takes due to their side tracking orders, you‚Äôll have a driver show up with an attitude problem, who is unable to handle an upset customer because they are not trained in customer service, let alone humility.  

I see why you charge the tip up front and don‚Äôt allow it to be changed after the delivery is made.   After all, you wouldn‚Äôt want tips to be based on the service we received, right?  My guess is you would lose a lot of drivers.

Why you ask? Well I think that the fees that come with the app is a little ridiculous. Especially when it comes to refunds! If something potentially happens to your food or you need to cancel an order your money back is not guaranteed. Not to mention that if your unfortunate enough to have to contact them your waiting time on the phone will be very long. I just don‚Äôt see why a five dollar meal will ring up to 15 on door dash. But as we all know business is business. 

Overall though if you don‚Äôt mind the extra fees and are looking for a convenient service to delivery whatever it is you please i do recommend this app. As someone who has had only one hiccup in the road the lady whom i spoke with on the phone was very kind and helpful despite the wait.

2746,This Business is Shady,False,2019-06-28 19:17:03,1,"DoorDash is an unethical company that pads their drivers‚Äô base pay with the tip that you add to your total. That means that they don‚Äôt pay their drivers the tip you give them plus their base pay, they just use the tip that they‚Äôre misleading you to believe is going to the drivers to pay them. This is theft. Plain and simple. 

Secondly, this company will routinely add restaurants to their delivery service without ever telling the restaurant about this. This in turn leads to bad reviews for the restaurants, not the doordash service, when said restaurants are rightfully confused by this shady business practice and mistakes are made either by the restaurant or the doordash drivers. It‚Äôs a huge drain on the reputation of these restaurants all because doordash, once again, can‚Äôt be bothered to go about their business in an ethical manner.

I‚Äôm ok with paying for delivery fee, service fee and tip, but they have misleading prices on food items that go directly to the company. So on top of the $7 extra you‚Äôre already paying for delivery you are also paying another $5-$20 on food prices depending on your order size. 
Uber eats and Postmates have actual prices that you would get in a restaurant.

Went through Door Dash who offered me a $5 refund or credit of the $9 pizza. No, I didn‚Äôt get ANY pizza, I don‚Äôt want a partial refund for it! I declined and sent an email.

But as soon as I got a car, this app got pretty much pointless. If you‚Äôre feeling lazy, it‚Äôs amazing to use but you‚Äôre paying the price for it. It just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it because half the time you pay $20+ for food when it‚Äôs less than $10 to drive over there, even with gas prices. If you cancel an order, be very careful because they will still try to charge if you didn‚Äôt get your food which they shouldn‚Äôt do in the first place unless a valid reason.

1. Doordash provided me a promo to entice me to place an order. At checkout they declined to honor that promo. There were no explanations. 
2. Doordash advertised no delivery fee initially for the restaurant I was ordering from, however, at checkout it somehow added a deliver fee. Was that a bug? I‚Äôm not sure. But given the other issues my guess is it‚Äôs a feature and they‚Äôre advertising of fee is wonky at best. 
3. Even if there was no ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù fee there was a 15% ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù which is not for the dasher. they mix that additional fee into the taxes section of the bill. Let‚Äôs face it Doordash, that‚Äôs a delivery fee through the eyes of the consumer trying to figure out how much it will cost to order delivery. 
4. They promote a monthly pass and that you can sign up for a trial to fees waived. However, when I went to sign up for that the app again had another ‚Äúerror‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt apply.

I was never contacted. The order never arrived because the store closed and my funds were automatically sent back to my card. What was the result? No money or credits left to reorder. They told me I have to wait 3-5 days later to receive my refund.

However, despite all of that, someone in customer service was nice enough to give me credit for a full reorder to another address. This person is a god and in my eyes, will always be revered at one.

I can only speak for my area but DoorDash feels like it has really gone downhill in the quality assurance.

The backbone of DoorDash.

EDIT: Major improvement by adding/revamping the Offers section. Still clearly reflective a pay-to-be-seen algorithm.

Sure enough when I came back the promo that was good until 2/13 it was gone. I then contacted support which was extremely unreliable.

They are also great about refunds and credits when the delivery is longer than expected or the food is messed up! My only two complaints is that they will say specific stores are closed when they are not and that the delivery fees/service fees can get really pricy sometimes. For instance, my last order was going to be $45 and I went on that stores website and did delivery straight from them and it was $7 cheaper just from service fees.

The first delivery driver sent to the location should be able to report to DoorDash that the restaurant can‚Äôt accept payment, and my order should be automatically cancelled and refunded.

They also routinely deactivate drivers as a result of customer fraud. There are a plenty of drivers out there that work hard and have great customer service skills, but DoorDash will always try to blame the driver first, even if the customer was rude, dangerous, etc. There have even been Dashers who have been bit by a homeowner‚Äôs dog, and DoorDash won‚Äôt even ban the homeowner from their platform.

I tried to recently give them chances but after multiple screwed up orders, AGAIN and VERY minimal to absolutely NO resolve being offered without it being a long drawn out process, I decided to never use door dash again. 3.) The last situation where I was offered no credit or refund when my order got screwed up was the straw for me. 

Door dash needs a better system in place to verify drivers are delivering orders and on time. They also need a better way of verifying everything a cx ordered is in a cx meal when handing it to a driver. Because penalizing customers for driver and restaurant issues is a sure way to lose customers.

No one seems to take the literal 5 seconds to check the name on the bag with the name on the phone. It‚Äôs so basic and elemental that it honestly bogs the mind. I get that mistakes happen but I‚Äôve had probably 60% of my orders come correctly. That is not an exaggeration. The rest are either delivered to the wrong address, lost or I am sent the wrong order. This is unacceptable. Going through customer service gets you to someone outside the country who really could not care less about you or your experience. Yes they offer refunds but they never fix the core problem - inconsistency. 

If I work a 12 to 16 hour day and place an order I do not want to have to hope they get the order correct. I‚Äôm just going to get my orders on my own from now on. I‚Äôll save money and have a much greater chance of getting what I ordered.

Then when placed no driver immediately accepted the delivery, so an inflated time got displayed.  As this was from a large chain I do not think they waiting an hour to start making the food, likely it took an hour to match my suburb address with a driver, basically starting the real wait then.

Another time our order was being made and it took quite a while for a dasher to accept it and our food arrived cold.  There have been several times it took a lengthy time for a dasher to accept the order thus taking way longer than anticipated to receive said order.  

I haven‚Äôt found an option to leave a review on a per order basis so it‚Äôs difficult to remember the details of all the less than efficient ones.  Unfortunately we can‚Äôt beat the convenience of the service so we continue ordering just wondering how it‚Äôll go.",BeeShortts,

Door dash has took sooooooo much money off my card. A total of $350. I linked 2 debit card to my accounts and they took money off both. My chase debit card had at least 25 unauthorized transactions that they had been taking off of my card for weeks I didn‚Äôt notice this until the other day.

Now, when I call said restaurant/food provider they tell me that I then need to get in contact with DoorDash and that they are not responsible for missing/inaccurate food orders, which to me does not make any sense since no matter where the food order takes place (online, phone, in person) the restaurant is obligated to fulfill the order! So not only do I not receive my food but I do not receive my refund either. I will never order from DoorDash again! There is no accountability since they can play ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù between companies. If I order a pizza from a specific place, I know where to go and where I can get a refund/new food.

2794,Terrible service,False,2019-05-20 04:18:29,1,"Seriously, maybe 1 in 10 delivery orders goes smoothly. I like DoorDash for the option to pickup as it cuts down on wait times for traditional takeout, however even that has major hiccups. 

For whatever reason, DoorDash uses a gps system that canNOT find my house. Every other delivery company/app/person whatever in history has been able to find my house except DoorDash. I ALWAYS have to call and give directions and then meet dashers outside because they won‚Äôt park and bring my food to my door. 

50% the order is wrong or incomplete. So much so that I had to defend how many times I‚Äôve contacted customer service for refunds and credits. I‚Äôm not making the orders wrong and doing a poor job delivering them, I‚Äôm just calling attention to the errors that I‚Äôm being charged for. 

Last, tipping should definitely be an option after delivery is complete. I hate when I tip well and then have a crap delivery. I‚Äôve had dashers not even show up and claim they delivered, tonight my dasher was sitting in a parking lot nearby refusing to answer their phone and saying they were waiting on tech support.

And it would take another 10 minutes to get to our house.  I called the restaurant and they said that wasn‚Äôt true, they were busy and that driver basically lied.

After speaking with DoorDash (via chat, because speaking to a live person nowadays is unheard of!) they tried to explain that the delivery person waited for ‚Äúa long time‚Äù and a credit was offered. After a bit of back and forth, we finally received a ‚Äúone time‚Äù refund back to our account.

It said the estimated time would be 25-30 minutes. Well it ended up taking over an hour and ten minutes. The food was cold upon delivery. The driver instantly had a story as I opened the door. Telling me how their elevator was out and they had to walk 5 flights of stairs. True or not. They could of given the delivery to someone else if they already knew they would have problems. Not to mention once I was alerted they picked up my food. It took another 20 minutes to get to me. And the restaurant is 2 minutes from my house... I have a feeling they were trying to do multiple order pick ups in the area. I watched as there car icon on the map moved around over those 20 minutes going to other restaurants.

I tried to find a restaurant on their app and it didn‚Äôt come up so i went to the restaurant and ordered directly online. They charged me 5.99 for delivery. I call the restaurant and they told me they use door dash. So when four dash delivered the food I told the dasher and he sent a note. I received nothing but we can‚Äôt find your order because I couldn‚Äôt call them. I could only email them. I received a call back tonight from some outsourced Asian company who didn‚Äôt speak much English. It was ridiculous and no one cared or even wondered what happened. This is a poorly run service that you should never pay.   I canceled that service immediately and will never recommend anyone pay for their service if there was a 0 I would have chosen that.

2800,App,False,2018-10-23 15:14:17,5,As far as the deliveries I have not had any issues. As for the app itself it could use some work. Mainly with the options you have when ordering. For example I was going to order a McDonald‚Äôs quarter pounder just the burger but I was going to add a medium fry. The app gives the option to add a fry to the burger but you cannot choose the size. I ordered the same thing from another delivery service and was able to choose the size. So if that option is there it needs to be more obvious because it was easier to just open another app than to look through this one. It is just a minor annoyance I will still order from DoorDash when they have what I want.,gfthkgffghh,
2801,You don‚Äôt get what you pay for,False,2018-11-05 12:06:41,3,"DoorDash recently came out with the door pass option where you pay $15/mo for free delivery and no fee. I wanted to write a review so that no one else has the same issue I did. This pass doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get free delivery and no fee from every restaurant. It won‚Äôt say by the restaurant so you‚Äôll have no idea. I used the door pass 3 times and one of those times I had to pay an extra $10 for delivery/fees. So the pass works 1/3 of the time. If I use door dash 3 times/week, my door pass that seemed so great suddenly isn‚Äôt. It ends up costing $55/mo for delivery and fees. There are other food delivery apps that have figured this out in a much better manner, I‚Äôll be switching and I encourage others to look into other apps if they don‚Äôt want to spend large amounts on fees and delivery.",saraandrajah,

When the door dash driver (Lynda) picked my food up she informed me that she was needing run other errands and it would take her about 30 minutes to get our food to us. We ordered nearest to our house so it would be fresh and hot when it got here. I talked to door dash and they said they allow there drivers to do multiple orders at once. So I guess they don‚Äôt care about delivering fresh food. I love Maudie‚Äôs Mexican food and guess I will drive next time, I was just trying out one of these food delivery services and now realize I should not!

Excuse me? You cancelled my order and want to ‚Äúoffer‚Äù me a refund? WTH is this? So I go back to the first agent and he says oh yeah I see another agent went in and cancelled and gave you a refund.

So they cancel DoorDash orders.  Problem is - DoorDash already takes the funds from their consumers account and takes 5-7 business days to refund.   You really need to improve your services or you are going to lose customers.   I‚Äôm done with DoorDash!   Also pay attention to the costs.

It‚Äôs not just once or twice, it‚Äôs consistent, and it feels scammy. Gonna switch to grubhub, less mark up on the food and the times have been much more consistent. Doordash used to be better, not anymore. Stop advertising shorter wait times when its going to be longer.

Just today, ordered and it was set to be 20-25min.  I‚Äôve seen the delivery time get set back 7 times, as my dasher completes other orders. Started at 2:10, now set to deliver at 3:15. Over an hour.

I can‚Äôt take calls from dashers if she‚Äôs gone and she might not be available to answer if there are questions. It‚Äôs also sometimes more hassle for the dashers to text if they are driving. One way to alleviate this could be to simply allow for multiple user profiles for families so that multiple people‚Äôs contact info can be added.

‚Ä¢ Another frustration is the lack of standards being held for food allergies. Additional instructions often are opted out of by restaurants these days which I can understand, as I‚Äôm sure some places may get some ridiculous requests, but if I can‚Äôt tell a burger joint I don‚Äôt want cheese on my burger and they don‚Äôt add the option to their menu then I can‚Äôt give them my business.

Pros: 
-drivers have been by and large very nice and polite
-usually very timely
-wide variety of food options
-the ability to add to your order from 7-11 was a game changer for sure

But now for the not so great...

Cons:
-holy delivery fee batman
-the time window for a refund is tiny and they actively deter you from asking for a direct refund to your method of payment and will instead seek to give you dash credits lower in amount than you paid (why am I tipping 4 different dashers to not pick up my order?)
-the biggest gripe...THEY ACTIVELY ALLOW CLOSED RESTAURANTS TO APPEAR AS ‚ÄúOPEN‚Äù THEN WILL JERK YOU AROUND FOR ANYWHERE FOR 1-3 HOURS BEFORE FINALLY CANCELLING (this has happened several times with different restaurants)

All in all it‚Äôs pretty good but if you‚Äôre ordering late I just suggest you check the store hours on google as DoorDash can‚Äôt be relied upon to be competent or caring about anything beyond their scope of delivery fees and shafting their drivers.

Not to mention how extremely expensive DoorDash‚Äôs ‚Äúservice fees‚Äù are, its wrong that you force customers to pay a minimum of $5 as a tip. 

I have also been a Dasher in the past and understand why doordash makes people tip before they submit their order. You make customers tip beforehand, so that you can advertise a higher payment to the Dasher. But on the other hand, it screws the Dasher because people can easily just decrease their tip after the order is delivered.

So by that time I just said cancel it as my coworker offered to go get us food.

This has resulted in me having to drive to meet the driver and get my food or tip the driver extra to bring it to the second location. I think the app could be more user friendly and easily prevent this. Any other delivery app I use uses your location or makes you pick the address before typing in the directory and it has helped to prevent this issue for me.

I‚Äôm in the service industry and I‚Äôve long believed that even POOR service deserves a tip as long as the job was still performed. 

The DoorDash bums have almost changed my position though. As much as I love that not one order has even been correct, eating food that wreaks of the drivers cigarettes and weed is much worse. I‚Äôd rather eat the WRONG order than what these drivers do.

Meanwhile, doordash punishes us for not taking long distance orders for virtually no money. Additionally doordash has recently started to hide the amount customers tip when we accept orders in an attempt to make low tip orders more likely to be accepted. This makes it nearly impossible to make decent money as all orders appear to be extremely low (3-5 dollars for 30-40 minutes of work).

The app had so many issues that it was just awful.  If you want to make extra, work with Instacart, there you are more in control and if something is a mess, you can get in touch with the person who placed the order.  

Overall, if you are or were a dasher, keep records so that when they get sued for pocketing the money and lowballing the dashers, you can get certain compensation.  

This company is just absolutely awful",Capt. Drago,

If food is always missing something or cold, do not punish your customer for submitting complaint on each order. i also pay extra tip to make sure food arrives warm, but i still get late deliveries. I will not do business with them for a while. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of customers willing to deal with this, but not me.

Anyway, over the course of the past year of living here, about half the time that doordash drivers drop off my food, it‚Äôs not at my house; they‚Äôd usually ignore me and it‚Äôd be 50/50 if doordash provided a reorder. Then, they started refusing to credit me - because I couldn‚Äôt PROVE it wasn‚Äôt delivered.

Fast forward... They then began sending photos recently upon drop off, and I finally had photographic evidence. So tonight when my food didn‚Äôt arrive, I screenshot the dasher‚Äôs message showing where it is, vs. my own photo of my front door (showing my house number for undeniable proof and clarity).

Door dash literally would not provide a reorder of my food, despite it being VERY obvious that my house and front door was NOT where the order was dropped off. My front door is glass, and I showed my house number. The dasher‚Äôs photo of where it was dropped was an all wood door; with a MULTITUDE of Halloween decorations out.

Someone picked up our order instead of the correct one and they delivered it to someone else but our order history says it was delivered to us. Spoke to the customer service for an hour but no resolution. The restaurant says it's door dash problem and won't solve it and door dash says nothing except refunding the money. At least something needs to be in the system to monitor if the assigned dasher is picking the right order or not. I ain't going to order in door dash again unless they do something about this.

2. Delivery prices on certain place is ridiculous. $7 for Taco Bell delivery? Nah, I used postmates. Can‚Äôt believe the difference. 
3. Tipping is required and before I even get my food?? How am I supposed to know what to tip if I haven‚Äôt even gotten my food?

I have noticed that their quoted time is much  different than their stated time after you have placed an order, sometimes almost twice the original estimate.

It‚Äôs a shame because most of their drivers are really lovely people who just want to do a job and are subject to the whims of the Door Dash App (which way underestimated delivery time) and the restaurant. 

The greatest problem I see is that when I order and I notice that my food is going to take twice as long to get there is no way to  cancel the order because the order has already been accepted by the restaurant; only to find out several minutes later that the restaurant has just received the order. 

So far, almost all of my meals have arrived lukewarm, cold or even, in the case of a cheesecake dessert, melted.

We found this out when our Chinese order was 80$ and we only had 45$ worth of food. Ouch!! 

The optional service for no delivery fees at 10$ a month is nice, but it doesn't apply to all restaurants. It's ridiculous when you end up having to pay their 9.9% fee, the $9.99 a month, and an additional delivery fee, plus tip. Way to give the finger to your customers, Door Dash!

If I go through the restaurant and drive there then I can just work with the restaurant to fix any issues instead of wasting my time with DoorDash support. I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money on the dash pass or expect them to help you with order issues.

On top of this, sometimes they go to the complete opposite direction to deliver someone else‚Äôs food first, and the ETA throughout the process is always wrong. It will freeze on say, 14 minutes, for more than 10 minutes, then the driver will have your food and the time will go UP. Then it will go from 8 min to Arriving now in 20 seconds. This is annoying at baseline. But when you live in an apt and are home alone with a young child and trying to coordinate feeding them, baths, bedtime, it is a nightmare.

Customer service is scripted and can unfortunately rarely do much for you, and sometimes you will get an estimated delivery time of let‚Äôs say 30 minutes and then at the time of the expected delivery there will suddenly be a new driver even though they were on route so you have to wait another 45 minutes, and no one can really ever tell you why this happens.

Checked them when delivered, thankfully, because they were not plain and had all the stuff I requested to be left off still on.
That situation gets rectified by you submitting for a credit, but your still out the sandwiches. My husband had just gotten home from a 6 hour truck trip and was starving and our Jeep is out of commission.
So Rueben offered to take them back to Wendy‚Äôs and get the plain sandwiches I requested. He was such a lifesaver!
Thought all was good until my husband goes to eat and asks me where his fries were...seriously? I was floored. So we had to do without those, but at least he got his chicken sandwiches (plain)

For example I couldn‚Äôt order a egg sandwich that wasn‚Äôt one of the prebuilt options or customize it in anyways When I can order from google‚Äôs postmates option with full customization it really is a problem with how DoorDash integrates a restaurant‚Äôs menu into their app. Also their design is really unintuitive as you have to change your address at the top to search for restaurants around you and it took me 20 minutes to find out that was the problem.

I‚Äôd really wish they had the option of uploading a picture of what your home looks like also maybe a picture of what the person looks like that way the door dash people don‚Äôt have a problem finding who they‚Äôre giving the order to.

My final straw was today when I was prompted to wear a mask and meet my driver for the food hand off and my driver wasn‚Äôt even wearing one and when I asked if he had any of the drinks we ordered or maybe if he had another bag of food for me (because clearly what we ordered was not all in one tiny bag) he started yelling at me ‚ÄúNo!

However, the last few deliveries, I have had ‚Äú30 minute deliveries‚Äù take 45-60 minutes as the driver was assigned another route before ours. This is frustrating to even have to express, as it should not be a business practice at all. It blatantly prevents you from meeting the estimated time you quote. I will probably look for an alternate service if this persists. I also have received no compensation for these deliveries that took double the quoted time.

Why even have an option to turn it off if it doesn't matter? And you can't turn notifications off completely because then you won't get updates about your order. It feels like a ploy to get you to keep your notifications on in order to send you promotional info. Kind of gross behavior on their part in my opinion.

No biggie, it happens.

The app physically prevented me from clicking on any support options. I was unable to change or adjust my order in any way, despite having done so in the past.

When I reached out to chat support, they told me there was nothing they could do as it wasn‚Äôt DoorDash‚Äôs fault. I disagreed, pointing out that the app prevented me from rectifying what should have been a simple issue. The support person repeated that there was nothing they would do to help me, and while I was actively typing a response the rep said that since they hadn‚Äôt heard from me in a ‚Äúwhile‚Äù that they would end the support session.

My suggestion to Doordash would be to not advertise delivery times until you have drivers lined up‚Äîmy biggest frustration is placing an order because it shows a delivery time of 30 or so minutes (which is average for food delivery), then after your order is placed, it‚Äôs delayed because they have to find a driver. Now your actual delivery time is over an hour sometime 1.5 hrs! Needless to say the food is cold by then.

I have been following the drivers on the map and they are taking multiple orders at the same time. Dasher is what they call the driver. Dasher picks up my order then goes to another restaurant and is waiting there 10 minutes while my food is getting cold. Then drops that order and by the time she shows up, it‚Äôs been 90 minutes. When I complain they say they are only a dasher. This app is seriously not working. Went from 5 stars to 0 0 star. UnInstalling now.",victornam,

When you use their service, the receipt will show that you are charged for taxes, Door Dash fees, and delivery fees. But not only are you paying those explicit DoorDash fees and delivery fees, Door Dash also marks up the prices of the food you are ordering and pocketing the markup themselves. THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE MARK UP TO THE RESTAURANTS. You will essentially pay $1-5 extra per item that will not benefit the restaurant, but Door Dash only. I called their customer service line, and they unapologetically confirmed this practice.  This drastically increases the fee you are paying for their services‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt benefit the restaurant. In fact, they are being sued by some restaurants because they didn‚Äôt even tell the restaurants that they were doing this. If you are willing to pay the extra fees to Door Dash for the convenience, that‚Äôs fine. Just do it with eyes wide open.",Legalbunnie,

Our order was totally wrong and missing the most expensive item and instead of refunding me they give me a credit for less than the total order. What happens if the second order is wrong? They just keep giving me a smaller and smaller credit? Ridiculous. Also you still pay a service fee even though delivery is free for the first 30 days and the app asks for a tip amount before the order even arrives. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would let me tip after so I naively just assumed the service would be decent and added a tip because I would hate to not have the option to tip good service.

3137,Over priced for poor service,False,2022-07-11 01:42:08,1,"I don‚Äôt understand why DoorDash charges the customer a delivery fee when it doesn‚Äôt go to the driver. So you have to pay that plus taxes AND a tip to be generous to the driver. It ends up being insanely expensive. You could pay up to 4 extra charges that are outside of the actual total for the food. 

The app has added stores that don‚Äôt actually participate with DoorDash so you wait for nothing. The times are off. If the restaurant forgets an item or messes it up, you don‚Äôt get the full refund for those items. It‚Äôs way less. There is no opportunity to work with the store to fix the item that‚Äôs missing or incorrect. You end up waiting for nothing.

3138,User friendly app but add ability to sort,False,2022-04-27 21:03:04,3,"Updated review: very high fees, 15% on top of everything else, makes it cost inefficient to use.   I ran comparisons on same restaurants with other apps and DoorDash always comes in at the highest, unclear if they pay drivers out of those but sounds like not so many people reduce the driver tips. Because if you add 15% DoorDash fees plus 15%-20% driver tip it‚Äôs at a 30%-35% premium. Not worth it. Prior review: Similar interface as seamless so that‚Äôs good as don‚Äôt need to get used to a new interface. I like the option to look by map what‚Äôs available.

On multiple occasions I have confirmed my Dasher was at the restaurant waiting for my order by chatting with them. Most recently I waited more than 90 minutes and then without communication or notification my order was canceled.  When I inquired with customer service i was told the Dasher canceled the order because they were waiting too long. Despite the fact that I communicated with this Dasher. Customer service also told me the restaurant did not know why the dasher was waiting and canceled.  Clueless, and the poorest of customer service on all parts.  This will be my last time.

This leaves me with cold food, which is sometimes soggy. At this rate it makes much more sense for me to just go and pick it up myself. The extra money I‚Äôm spending on convenience is no longer worth the quality of food I‚Äôm getting. That being said, some dashers are incredibly sweet and I am aware it‚Äôs not their fault.

Your app is something I like but you need to have your drivers start using masks and gloves when they drop off food. Everybody has been told to do this and it helps make everyone be and feel safer!

It‚Äôs great that you have this service with our new reality of social distancing but you need to address this issue of safety for drivers and customers. I will continue to score this app lower until you can fix this important need of gloves and masks for your drivers.

Example: I had a RAW steak and ice cold (literally came out of the freezer/never cooked) food sent to me by Bob Evans. I called immediately . Several days of phone tag and my $50 meal I was given a credit of $4! 

I caught numerous delivery drivers stealing/eating food! I bought a gallon of sweet tea and I watched them take a cup they had from their back seat, fill it up with my tea - keep the gallon and cup me a dirty used cup from their floor. Did customer service ever respond to my complaint? Nope!

And the app rarely tracks a drivers location correctly. On two occasions the food appeared to have been gone through and the order was missing extra sides. Once a woman ‚Äúdasher‚Äù was supposed to deliver my food and it was a way younger guy that showed up. Once a ‚Äúdasher‚Äù dropped my entire order in the driveway and still tried to get us to take the food.

Then, after purchasing the meal, the app says the delivery time will be 80-98 minutes. I then had to call and customer service then provided me with a different driver who was much closer.

2) quick and easy app

Here is an experience that was extremely uncalled for:
I had ordered from a local pizza shop- nothing crazy. it was literally 2 items. My driveway is 900 feet and there are two houses on both sides at the top, so i could see why one could/may get confused. However, the man delivering spoke little to no english and walked down my driveway after driving his car into the side of my property and getting his car STUCK. i asked him if he would like me to help him and he said ‚Äúno‚Äù and proceeded to continue to try to drive his car out of my grass- creating more mud ruts and to be stuck even more. He then, was not able to leave my house for 2 hours and decided to call the cops instead of a tow truck. I then had two police officers knocking on my door. I realize if one is lost they may be confused but that does NOT mean to drive your car into someones grass. I had to pay to get it fixed because the mud was so deep that even when it dried up- the ruts were still there.

Doordash told me they had several people complain about that dasher but they flat out told me there was no way for them to prevent her from delivering to me again. Then they disabled MY account to prevent me from using their service at all. That was their solution. I was a frequent customer and used them a few times a week for a year. I was stunned.

Pros
-App functions as intended. Main functions: Food, Search, Orders, and Account are displayed clearly at the bottom of the app.
-Depending on my location, multiple restaurants displayed when searching and restaurants I didn‚Äôt know about.
-Reasonable delivery fees ranging from $1.99 to $5.99 for most restaurants in my area around $1.99 or $3.99.
-Delivery has always been prompt and only had to contacted a driver twice to provide clarification on directions.
-Customer service support is available via email or phone. Customer Representatives were always helpful when there was an issue. Also, great follow up after a resolution was provided to ensure satisfactory with resolution.

Cons

While I understand the need to ensure people don‚Äôt miss their delivery, I feel that 11 notifications is a bit excessive.

The restaurant had already made the food  and I had no food in my home. The restaurant begrudgingly said they would deliver if I paid AGAIN - it had been made 45 minutes (they should have billed door dash not me as they were delivering due to doordash issue and it would be trashed if not delivered as they cannot hold food and it was a custom order). So now I paid 2x until a credit comes from doordash in 10 days.
They charge you for things such as cheese that comes on a sandwich in the restaraunt. 

Items are frequently missing or wrong but this does not happen when visiting the restaraunt in person and they do not hold drivers accountable (they are a 3rd party company not doordash employees come to find out). 

They do not care at all about customers and we pay a lot more to use them to get substandard service and missing or no food. They will not even let you speak to management.

While DoorDash has often given us credit for these issues, the problems have become so consistent, we cancelled our monthly membership and switched to Uber. In fact, the last straw came when we ordered pizza for my son‚Äôs birthday. He was so excited to get pizza from his favorite restaurant, but DoorDash messed up again with our food just sitting there at the restaurant with no one to pick up the order.

The receipt from the order was in the bag and proved she only bought and brought us 6 tacos. They gave us only a $7 credit and expected us to reorder the 6 tacos and with all the fees pay an additional $3 out of our pocket. I‚Äôm a dasher myself and that is horrible customer service.

Most of the restaurants that are on the list after midnight are 24 hours. So the Dashers like to lie and say the restaurant is closed. When I call the restaurants to confirm the Restaurants always tell me that no one showed up from DoorDash to pick up the order. When I made my complaint to the DoorDash Customer Service they decided to block my Debit Card. Now I can‚Äôt but anything from DoorDash.

Why am I tipping for service upfront when I have no idea how it‚Äôs gonna turn out until after I received it. My first time ordering with you guys my Dasher was 40 mins late bringing my food from a location that was 11 minutes away from me. He also couldn‚Äôt find my simple location and took about 10 mins of me standing outside in the cold to locate him! At this point because of the way your app is set up I also already tipped this person which is absurd! I should not be directed to tip before I get my order that is all! I also wonder if the Dasher can see the tip before drop off which also plays a huge part in how they deliver. Just doesn‚Äôt make any sense!

For my order being passed around by drivers and ETA for orders reaching over 100 minutes, this is too unreliable and lacking in customer support. They really need to work on their notification to customers when orders exceed the original ETA time. every order that I have had issues with had an ETA of 30 minutes roughly which continued to go up exceeding 100 minutes. Customer support says that they will issue you a credit for your inconvenience, which they never issue the credit. I have even went as far as deciding not to wait two hours for an order when the driver was over 20 miles away, and picking up the order myself, but yet I never received a refund.

 I work for a small coffee shop that serves panini sandwiches and they‚Äôre popular, so we started taking phone orders. Being that paninis have to be on the press for 5-7 minutes, we started making them 10 minutes before confirmed pick up time. Trusting our customers, we decided to take payments at pick ups, but that‚Äôs when trouble started arising, we decided to stop.
 We started getting no shows for some orders and we‚Äôve been burned by plenty of individuals. We tried getting payments over the phone but some customers were offended... So the owner and manager decided to cancel the whole phone ordering. 
 I know that this review doesn‚Äôt really affect us because we have not partnered with DoorDash or any food delivery services but when crazy individuals decide to add a business that isn‚Äôt theirs and DoorDash drivers start showing up... it gets old really fast. 
 In the afternoon, there‚Äôs only 2 employees and having to deal with an upset DoorDash driver while closing and helping customers is hell!!

And other occasions I pay for an order and don‚Äôt get everything I paid for. Are the drivers supposed to check if everything is in the bags?

I ordered 3 Subs from Jersey Mikes through the DoorDash site and my sub total was $10 more than subtotal from the store. So with a dash pass you pay $10 which cuts out your delivery fee $4.99 to $0 and it reduced added processing fees from $8.68 to $4+ taxes. Then I added a tip and it didn‚Äôt show on receipt. In the long run they are for sure making $ to pay Drivers. It is kinda scam like. I think there should be a disclaimer upfront saying food costs more through them then the actual restaurant. Also where is my drivers Tip because it was pulled out of my account? How do I remove that dash pass ?,+Nikki,

I was expecting a ‚Äúsorry about that‚Äù message like I usually get when I message online support people. Instead I got a friendly apology and a refund! This was a very distressing event as I am a very careful person during covid and have asthma and doordash did more than I expected. The customer service guy was very nice too. I also had no problems with deliveries until this guy that came by tonight so even the drivers are in general really chill and prompt people.,Maddy's Games,
3334,Tons of Complications with Options,False,2020-10-07 21:30:38,5,"It appears that restaurants do not have the necessary control over their menu options, substitutions, etc. or the set up process isn‚Äôt user friendly to restaurants who would like of take advantage of the app.  Regardless, we have made several attempts to correct issues both through doordash and through each establishment and nothing changes.  

On the flip side when your order does occasionally get filled incorrectly or it‚Äôs missing something Doordash is quick to make it right.  I really appreciate this aspect of the app.",Duvuvuei,
3335,Problem with delivery.,False,2020-05-02 19:51:13,3,"I liked door dash until I started having the following happen almost every time I used this app.  It‚Äôs really frustrating when a dasher picks up multiple orders and delivers to multiple people outside the ‚Äúgroup ordering‚Äù. I hate cold/soggy/rubbery food and I especially find it annoying when it occurs at the hand of the driver delaying the delivery due to the above. I‚Äôve also had dashers on the west side assign themselves to my order- I eat and live on the east side of town so by the time they get over here to the restaurant my food is already cold and by the time it gets to me, it‚Äôs not even edible (meal dependent). I even cancelled my door dash due to these issues. First time using it since that occurred several months ago, hoping it goes well.",annoyed tired mom,
3336,The worst delivery app,False,2020-09-05 14:05:08,1,We have constantly given door dash many chances. Food has been late or not even picked up. First time the driver didn‚Äôt pick up the food and the poor restaurant owner waited until after close for her to pick it up. The owner said the driver sounded ‚Äústrung out‚Äù when he called her. We ended up getting refunded but there was no way to hold the driver accountable. Second time had an order for breakfast 7 minutes away from my house I literally get the food 27 minutes later from pickup...of course everything is cold at this point. I called customer service first rep answered but all I heard were people talking in the background and crinkling noises. Second rep put me on hold and refunded me $5 dollars even though my total order was about $18 cold food that can‚Äôt be reheated without overcooking. This service screws it‚Äôs customers and local restaurant owners over.,Brookitar,
3337,Over it,False,2020-07-23 07:25:59,2,"It‚Äôs a great idea but poorly executed by the company. Times are almost always wrong because they allow drivers to take more than one order at a time. Customers should be given the choice to decline a driver if they have accepted more than one order. This is now the third time In a row that my order has arrived late and cold because another order was taken before mine. Sometimes it being late is fine, but tonight for example I ordered at a specific time while at work so it could be delivered near the beginning of my break, even with allowing a 10 minute delay. Unfortunately my order was over 20 minutes later than the estimated time and I was unable to eat at all. Also, the drivers rarely follow the special instructions, which just adds to the frustration.",Katie Gish,
3338,Was good until they got sneaky.,False,2020-06-28 14:17:31,1,"So far, I have ordered a few times through them, once my order was more than half missing, I got into a chat with someone for a refund for only the missing food, they kept insisting on giving less than half of what I paid as a refund. Then just yesterday, my WHOLE order got canceled, they refunded me the whole amount, then snuck in a second charged for that entire canceled order. I got in touch with someone again through chat who fixed this for me, but I should never have been charged for the second order to begin with. This person told me they only gave me a partial refund! I literally received nothing from the order, as it got canceled as soon as I placed it! That‚Äôs just really shady, and not right of them to do. Keep an eye on your banks statements when they issue refunds, they may try to sneak in a second charge!",Kristina I B,
3339,Fine until something goes wrong,False,2020-06-06 03:00:51,1,"this app has a good layout but they don't do a good job of treating a problem. My dashers car stopped working so i was told to pick up the food from them (which defeats the purpose), i went to get it but they were towed somewhere else, support tried calling me but they had technical problems, and then i had to resort to the help chat that sucked. I wasted time and gas because of poor communication and they couldn't even get in touch with me and they're chat is so slow. It takes 5 minutes for them to send each message. The whole ordeal took around 3 hours! All they offered was just a refund which is treating the whole situation like a minor thing when in reality was an unacceptable ordeal. I was able to make them give me 10 credits for compensation but I should have been given the meal for free along with the refund.",francheesemo715,
