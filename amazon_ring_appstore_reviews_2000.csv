0,Huynh Family iTunes,False,2017-10-21 14:48:08,Ring is the answer to every mothers desire to have a doorbell that doesn’t wake a baby,5,"I have many ring products that all tie together seamlessly into this app. The video doorbell, new spotlight cam, stick up cam, and the brand new security system. My family, pets and I feel safe away on trips and feel like we have a great prevention from break ins. With the low cost of the video storage for all of our video devices I am always aware of what goes on in or around my house at all times. I feel secure and never have any issues setting up, connecting or using their devices. They all integrate wonderfully and I could not be happier. I have recommended to many friends and family members to get just a ring video doorbell. As a new mom with dogs it was hard when anytime someone rang, packages, whatever, our dogs would wake our baby. Now with Chime, I set a tone that doesn’t illicit barking and am aware when anyone is at the door or rings the doorbell. The motion detection is amazing and really easy to customize to not get everyone hat walks by, or you can if that’s what you want. Absolutely love this company and their products. Every time they come up with something new I’m pleased with how well thought out it is and how well it integrates.",

My settings are set to be as fast and sensitive as possible. Same problem many other of your other customers complain about. I wish you would at least have the option of turning off the 10 minute timer that shuts down live view. Should be the customers decision to drain the battery in live view.  That’s why I bought an extra battery. Also, one of the times I tried calling you I was given the option of making an appointment for you to call me back but you never did. And Kaitlyn@Ring, don’t bother to paste your typical reply telling me to email you because you’re so concerned. I’ve read your response back to other customers so many times that I’ve memorized it. Customers should realize if you have to paste that same cookie cutter reply addressing everyone’s concern then Ring and your customers have a really big problem.

2,Hcjfjfifufuf,False,2022-09-09 22:04:57,Ring Ring...,2,"Update; Smart Alerts is horrible, it will not always detect and alert you of a person & sometimes family will be in house before even getting alert. Suggest turning it off- it needs a major rework. 

Update; Now it says person is detected and by time I can view the video is just gone, like it never happen. I saw a person in the preview.. now I will never know what they was doing. Issues with Loading. Resolution is awful. I have certifications in networking, I am skilled in getting very good connections and fixing connection issues. With all of my skills there is still connection issues with the Ring. Sometimes it will not load at all, and then you hear a knock at the door- unable to see who it is or know if someone is trying to break in. I have the Ring Floodlight, Ring Doorbell, & Ring security Cameras. All of them have the same issues. This is not a problem with my connections, but with the devices. The resolution on these cameras are AWFUL! You can barely make out faces unless they are close and still, you cannot see license plates or car model etc. If I could do it over again I would go with a regular camera set-up, even though the installation would be difficult. To their credit other brands are just as bad- such as the Arlo etc. Buy nice or buy twice! The monthly fee is lowest around and the biggest benefit. Its better than nothing... but unreliable, and undependable.",
3,magnum6363,False,2021-03-25 21:49:55,Motion zones: BIG STEP backwards!!!,3,"First, I want to say that I have been a fan of Ring for 3 years. In fact, I have recommended Ring over other systems to friends and family many times. I have multiple AC powered only flood cams and doorbell cams around my property.  I have AC only cams because of the detail and flexibility in the configuration of multiple motion zones on these devices.  However, in a recent update, they removed the Active checkbox that allowed for the selection of one of multiple zones defined on a cam.  As a result, you must delete your other 2 motion zones when you need one of them active.  Then, when you want them back, you must redefine them!  Why is this an issue?  Let’s say you have cams looking down on a basketball court.  When the team is practicing, you do not need to record all activity.  Instead, you just want the area/zone around the court protected by your camera system.  If someone enters the zone, you want notified.  Otherwise, no alerts.  As someone who designs interfaces and software as a profession, I can tell you that this was an unforgivable decision.  You need to think long before ever removing a powerful feature that has been inherent for years.  For this reason, my experience with the app is now a frustrating experience.  I have since stopped recommending Ring.  I am now looking for another solution.",
4,Km jailjljh,False,2019-07-19 03:16:57,Can’t chime and stops working randomly,1,"We’ve had our Ring Pro for over two years and have intermittently had an issue where it would stop working right after someone rang the doorbell and wouldn’t work again until it was unplugged and plugged back in. This issue has been prevalent since a few months after we purchased. Any time I called customer service they would just have me run a reset and say it was working again and that there was nothing else they could do for me. Well finally a customer service person was unexpectedly helpful and had me do all sorts of tests to check how much power it was getting and come to find out it gets enough power, but there’s some sort of ‘fluke’ issue some of the doorbells have that prevent them from being able to operate all the time when the in-house chime is also activated. And wouldn’t it happen to be that we finally figured the cause of this problem out a few months after the warranty period expired. They were gracious enough to offer a discount on purchasing a new one, but if I didn’t want to buy another possibly faulty doorbell I would need to deactivate my internal chime, and just keep checking my app to see when it stops working so I can go home and perform another reset. I just got done with another reset because I realized today that my doorbell hasn’t worked for over a week. I would definitely not recommend this doorbell to anyone, and I will be searching for a replacement as soon as I finish posting this review.",
5,upsettyspaghetti1101,False,2020-05-13 11:11:05,Gift from hell,1,"We got a ring for Christmas last year and were so excited to set it up! It had always sounded like a nice idea to be able to check who was at the door and I park on the street in front of our house so I could keep an eye on that as well. I think the only time motion is detected is when I walk walk out the front door myself or if a car drives by. I’ve had deliveries arrive and people knock on the door and there’s no motion detected and no recording in sight. Luckily the doorbell function seems to work (unless the battery is dead which is every other week) and I’ll never know who is at the door because of all the connectivity issues and super long waiting times to load the feed (even after upgrading the internet several times). Our neighborhood has had several instances of car parts stolen and even a break in at our neighbors and of course every time the battery has either been dead, no connection during the time it occurred to record, or simply no motion detected. Don’t even get me started on the online community! I shared a video I did catch of a strange man taking pictures of my neighbors house (two days before the break in) and was repeatedly called stupid and a terrible person for not calling the police despite the first sentence of the post stating the police had already been called and this was a warning to others that saw him in the neighborhood. Save yourself the time, money, and frustration and keep it simple with a button and a battery.",
6,Stewbabyq,False,2021-04-27 03:11:40,Write down your serial numbers!,1,"Ring does not keep your serial numbers in the app nor in your account. If your device is stolen and the police want the serial number, it is not easy to get. After searching all over the app and your account and you cannot find it you decide to search for a phone number to call Ring. When you finally get a human on the phone and you explain that your device was stolen and the detective needs the serial number and the human tries to tell you where to find the serial number in your stolen device, you about lose it. She finally got it for me. Then I asked about the report that I filed with Ring to try to get a replacement device, she found it supposedly. I never got ANY response from Ring after I sent it in. None. After I got off the phone with the rep I got a customer service survey AND the same email that I had gotten before on how to file the report about a stolen device. Why did I get this? Do I have to fill it out again? Just write down your serial numbers.  With all of that said, I have to say that the app has gotten VERY SLOW. I used to love my Ring cameras over my Arlo ones. This has changed. The Arlo app is so much better and faster and you can easily flip through videos without closing one and opening the next or trying to keep a timeline from resetting to the end. Get it together Ring. I have 9 of your cameras and I will probably switch back to Arlo if you continue to slide.",
7,professorofenglish,False,2020-06-11 11:26:54,Major Glitch in This App,2,"There is a major flaw in the Ring app for iPhones. Whenever I’m alerted of motion or the presence of a person in front of my Ring camera, the recorded video of the incident is visible but never available/clickable. I can see this most recent recording on the history page, but it won’t open, yet all of the other recordings can be opened and played. I then have to close out the app that I had just opened and access the recording after that. This is a waste of time that could be dangerous if someone were trespassing on my property and looking to break in. I even made sure to download the update for the app, yet this problem still persists consistently. What is the point of having a security camera if I have to twiddle my thumbs and jump through hoops to watch the video that alerted me of the presence of unexpected motion? Being alerted at 3 a.m. of motion and then having to open and close the app a couple of times before knowing what triggered the alert is nerve-wracking. This needs to be fixed ASAP. We spent a lot of money on three Ring cameras, which are only as good as the software that comes with them.

I want to add that it takes forever to connect with the live view for one of my cameras, which makes that camera virtually worthless. I always have to walk to that side of the house and look out the window after receiving an alert about motion that was detected there.",
8,Mark evens 601,False,2018-10-18 15:32:44,Connection error cannot load your locations. It’s been like this for a month. Ring can’t fix,1,"Ring technical support has done nothing but make excuses for the past month. They refuse to refund my money for the monthly service they can’t supply. Refused to refund for the doorbells I purchased .they are not usable on their app Any longer . It reads the locations will not load. Bottom line they blocked me out of my account. But they continue to claim that it’s a bug in their system. I have spoken with several of their customer service reps. Each one has a different story and different line of BS. Appears they read off a 3 x 5 cards and have no clue what they’re really doing. Although based in the United States I still feel service is no better than what I get if you were calling overseas. My last two phone calls requesting supervisors were left on hold for over two hours. No one ever came on. Eventually I hung up . Very bad customer service. My first ring was original before they change their name. My current one is less than eight months old . The old one and new ones are still in service. We cannot access the system through any of the phones we own ,computers or iPads.  With the lack of knowledge customer support has about their product in their inability to fix the problems. I would think very hard before purchasing any of their equipment. Also as a follow-up I am still waiting for return call for the last five days.

9,LaciDRoy,True,2018-04-10 19:50:20,Updated review......Doesn’t always record.,1,"Update! 
Ring sent me a new ring doorbell as well as a chime extender. Very nice of them. However, now when my videos record, it’s just a black screen 2 out of 3 recordings. The videos that do actually record, some of them are basically just a frozen screen shot but no video. So I’m paying to keep these videos, that do me absolutely no good. I’ve been troubleshooting with an Ashlei O. But can’t figure it out. I’ve done everything she asked. I’ve sent her 6 emails since her email telling me what to try. She just won’t respond to me. It’s now been a week since I’ve heard from any one that can possibly help me. Not sure if they sent me a refurbished ring which is why it’s having issues. My internet connection is great. My router is in a good place. I have no idea. But a few of my clients that have come to my home this last week have asked about my ring doorbell. I’ll continue to tell them to stay far away until someone actually calls or emails me to figure out the broken replacement ring doorbell that they sent me. 

I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong or if I have a defective ring doorbell. It will only occasionally alert me when someone comes to my front door. I had a group of kids, on my porch, leaving a derogatory comment spelled out in rocks, and it didn’t record them at all. I would’ve loved to see who that was. But it’ll record a car driving by on the street in front of me. Not really worth the money.","{'id': 2905950, 'body': 'Hi LaciDRoy,\n\nFirst, I’m so sorry to hear this!

10,Heiliner,False,2018-04-07 16:55:14,Love and Hate Product,5,I love the concept of the product. The reviews about slow lag times are true. To make the cameras functional I have had to purchase two cameras per each location.  For example I have a RingPro doorbell and a second camera facing 90 degrees off the other camera. One of the two cameras gets the intruder. I have the same set up for the driveway; two cameras at different locations. The cameras caught some fellow around 2 in the morning walking up into the driveway and trying the door handles of the locked cars. The RingPro extenders don’t have enough range. I have had to purchase a more powerful extender to get the speed and quality up on one of the cameras. The notification on the iPhone cannot be changed so the sound is like tinker bell. I have asked for a vibrate only notification but so far nothing. Bottom Line: don’t expect to purchase ONE camera and have everything work without problems. This product is still being developed. UPDATE: Ring keeps getting better...they have done away with the “tinkled bell” alert sound as the only alert sound and added voice alerts which are much better. Ring has also added a “snooze” function which will stop alerts up to 2 hours.,
11,FloridaNeighbor,False,2018-10-07 19:08:27,BAD UPDATE,3,"I love the concept of the Ring device and instant notifications triggered by motion or a doorbell ring. Unfortunately, this falls short when timing is critical. To only see the back of someone because of the delay in activation defeats the purpose of the device. Now for the recent update. I updated the app, as prompted, to ensure the best results  for my security device. BIG MISTAKE!! All of my recordings were deleted! When I tried view even the most recent motion activation, I was able to receive the notification, but I had a message stating my plan was expired attached to every single notification (Motion, Live View and Doorbell). I spent an hour on the phone with customer service as my plan was not expired. The rep couldn’t explain what happened. On a whim, I deleted the app and reinstalled it, and tadah,  everything came back. Ring People: if you are reading this, please correct whatever went wrong!!! I didn’t even know that my videos were deleted or that newer stuff was not being recorded until I went into the videos to delete the ones I didn’t want. This is potentially dangerous when homeowners think they are protected by surveillance and that surveillance fails from a flaw in the app without even knowing it until it is too late. Hopefully everything doesn’t get screwy again as I only discovered the issue today.",
12,Chmsyd,True,2018-06-23 05:18:04,Good technology that needs work,5,"I must say it is awesome knowing what is going on at home when your away. I gave this product only two stars initially because I have had numerous problems with it ever since I got it. I have had problems with WiFi connection, batteries and poor video quality or delayed play back when someone is either at the door or in my driveway. I contacted Ring support more than I can count and every time I did the same trouble shooting that never fixes the problems, you would be better off getting something that actually works, I am taking it down and replacing it with something that works. I may consider using Ring again when all the problems are fixed, until then better luck next time

Update: 
After speaking with Sam from Ring headquarters, she did everything she could to help me. Sam offered a full refund for the products and stayed in touch even after I received my refund. Because of Sam, I may consider using Ring Cameras in the future. Sam know how to treat a customer and she made sure I was satisfied.

13,Love0905,False,2019-08-12 08:44:28,Unreliable Security System,1,"My husband and I have the Wireless Spotlight cameras. One on our front door for package thieves and one on our garage to watch over my car because we only have one garage. While the cameras come in handy in us keeping an eye on our packages while we aren't home, they're really good for nothing. They're inconveniently dysfunctional. The motion detector really isn't that great. There has been two incidents right in front of our driveway and the cameras caught nothing. One of our guest's car got broken into. When we looked back at the videos, it recorded cars driving by and all, but nothing of what happened. The front door camera captured a small glimpse of someone already walking right off so we have no idea if it was that person or not. So helpful, right? The other time, someone threw a glass bottle at our guest's car. Once again, nothing. I noticed that if there's continuous movement, the camera records the first 30 seconds and that's it. Basically, all it'll catch is someone walking up to your house and what they do is history. This makes Ring not a reliable security system at all. My biggest problem with the cameras is, sometimes the live video won't even load! And NO, it's not because of our wifi. We plan on getting rid of Ring for a security system that records 24 hours instead. If you are looking for some pros or special features of Ring cameras, that can be found on the product description.",
14,Sircoffee,False,2018-12-12 02:33:21,"New idea, use AWS for motion tagging",4,"Use the power of amazons AWS to tag possible motion that sets off my cameras. Simply place a blue or red box around the item triggering the camera detection. Take a still of the video with the item triggering my motion detector and send that image as a notification on my iPhone. That way I can chose to open the app and view the video or see that it was my wife pulling into the driveway. 

It takes too long for me to move from the notification to the video, even on high speed WiFi with my iPhone XS Max. By the time I view the live video, the item setting off my motion detector may no longer be in frame. Then, I have to wait for the motion history to load the video to your servers in order to view. I spend a minute refreshing the list, all the while the item setting off my motion detector has moved to a new location. 

I love the cameras and the system overall, but the time delay from notification to viewing my camera feed is too slow and cumbersome. This eventually causes me to pass on viewing some motions. If it happens to me, then I know it happens to others. One day my lack of motivation is going to cause harm and render your services null, the whole reason I’ve paid for cameras and video storage in the first place.",
15,MDK1705,False,2017-11-04 01:31:33,Floodlight Cam needs more control of lights,3,"I own both a ring doorbell and a ring floodlight cam. Overall I am pleased with both. The cameras are excellent, day and night. The motion sensing is almost perfect (but occasionally does miss activity). Notifications are almost immediate (most of the time). I purchased the Floodlight cam to replace a motion sensing fixture that had a photocell for dusk to dawn operation year round at 50% intensity until it detected motion, then 100% intensity until no longer detecting motion. This was a great product that worked well. The ring floodlight cam was advertised to have a dusk to dawn feature but all I can find is to set specific on/off times, even though dusk and dawn change throughout the year. I have yet to find a way to program the lights to come on at dusk and off at dawn regardless of time of year. FAQ said that although dimmability was not available yet it would be offered in a later update. When I purchased the floodlight cam I was promised by the ring rep that it would be an available feature soon. I’m still waiting for the dimmer feature. I’ve tried to leave the lights on all night but my neighbors say it is too bright and shines in their windows. Please update the app with both the dawn to dusk feature and the dimmer feature as promised. Then I will be pleased to give 5 stars.",

Live view only worked once for us and it was bad quality and kind of annoying that we can talk and see people clearly when the ring communicates to the phone but not when the phone communicates to the ring. Night vision is very over exposed. Faces are not recognizable. Sometimes motion activation is very late. Not all the time but that takes things down a notch on the trust factor. Battery also died after a week after charging. Thought it would be at least a couple months before we had to recharge. Might have to find a better option as we don’t have a doorbell wire so we have to rely on battery power. We’ll use it for a while before we make our decision but as of right now we’re just kind of happy with what we got.

The doorbell for 20 months.   I have a Wasserstein solar panel hooked up to one spotlight cam. The battery stopped charging two weeks ago. That’s another story. I haven’t used these cameras in the cold yet. We had a few  cold nights in the teens.  I thought maybe it was the cold so I brought them all inside, charged batteries for over 12 hours.  Even tho the website says operating temp is like 4°. But that’s the operating temp or the DEVICE. I’m wondering what the operating temp of the BATTERIES are. 
Installed everything again.  Solar panel still not charging battery. (I’ll deal with Wasserstein later). 
In all three products  the video is choppy and pixelating and slow. I cannot touch the screen to dismiss the onscreen controls. Nothing has changed in my WiFi settings. The router is in the same spot it’s been for four years. This seems to have started after the recent update.

They switched out my doorbell but the app won't allow me to delete videos from the old doorbell. When I try to delete them it asks me to login again. I was told the next app update would fix this but there have been a couple since then without a fix. 
     Also the company can see your battery status even if your doorbell is hard wired but you can only see battery status if it's not hard wired. Again I was told this feature was inadvertently removed and would be added back in the next update. No such luck so far. App needs some work in my opinion. There are better doorbells out there and when this one dies I will switch.
          The neighborhood feature places me in a city I have never lived at.  I have talked to tech support and they know it’s an issue but two more updates later and still it isn’t fixed. 
         Last is the doorbell “shows motion alert” at 3:47 every morning. Once again I was told they know about this bug but several updates later and it still is alerting me in the middle of the night to “motion” that doesn’t exist. What does tech support say?

The camera is no longer recording the entire thing. It's pretty much only taking a snap shot. A get a motion alert and nothing is there because the camera is constantly freezing. I paid the yearly fee for video not pictures or nothing at all. Ring Pro is absolutely useless and like having no security feature at all if not doing what it was intended to do.

Update: Almost a year later and this doorbell is still a disaster. It worked great for about three months and then the developers started rolling out updates and the thing hasn’t worked like it should since. I have been through four of these doorbells within a year. The last one just stopped working completely. I’m a software engineer for over 20 years and sometimes being on the phone with CS for over an hour can be insulting. The video stream is choppy and not consistent. I continue to get pixelated video and freezing. UPS rings the doorbell and the video shows the driver leaving in his truck.

I live in a rural area and the only traffic I usually get are family members or deliveries.  I had a digital doorbell prior to ring and although ring was simple to install, I apparently didn’t install ring correctly (because the doorbell no longer works), but I also have “Chime” and prefer Chime over the digital doorbell any day!  I also love seeing pictures/comments from the neighbors with ring (there seem to be a lot of us) - ring makes a great neighborhood watch.

I have two very small complaints (which is why I scored it a 4 and not a 5):  I thought with power the battery would last a long time without requiring a charge.  It lasted almost 2 months.  The bright side is that I was sent an email warning me about the battery requiring a charge and the battery took seconds to remove/replace to charge it.  My second complaint is that activation is supposed to be triggered by infrared activity and not motion, yet when it’s windy, ring goes off a lot.  I could have gnats or something flying by, but I never see anything in the video.

Overall - I love ring and think it’s a great product and am exploring other products in the ring family.",

I did find out after that even the wired isn’t truly wired and has a battery. Regardless, I get really good video quality, the motion works 95% of the time, and as long as you set your settings for motion to say second bar over from left I haven’t had any problems. Also don’t set motion zone to the road or every car is gonna trigger it and drain battery.  I would like to see an option for  video quality in playback for when I’m not on WiFi. It’s just about impossible for me to watch a video otherwise. Possibly could add scrollable timeline pictures so we don’t have to watch the video and save data. The new live view feature I do not like. Maybe I haven’t had a chance to use it much but old one is much less complicated. Should have had some helpful emoji descriptions or similar over new buttons to help people understand better.

This looks like a programming bug to me since the timing is so consistent. I have one of those super strong set in concrete mailboxes that doesn’t move a millimeter, so it is not blowing in the breeze, and the motion sensor is properly installed inside the mailbox (which has no bugs living inside). I also have a strong signal to the bridge which sits in a window facing the mailbox and the wire is sealed with a grommet so no moisture gets inside. I have reviewed the video footage and looked out the window when alerts occur and nothing is happening (I live at the end of a dead end road). There must be something happening in the device or bridge or Ring service on an hourly basis which is causing these invalid alerts. I have also tried to silence them at night (6pm to 6am) using the disable schedule feature, but that doesn’t seem to work either. In addition, all of the mailbox sensor functionality lives under the “lights” section in Ring, which doesn’t make any sense…it should show up with the other motion alerts from my doorbell which also cause the camera to record any activity, not be buried under the lights section where no one will look for them.

I like the neighborhood feature and the ease of integrating other Ring products. However, the app insists on being the most important thing going on. If you select banner notifications, they do not automatically disappear unless you do it manually. This becomes especially problematic when I am using my phone for directions and the banner blocks the next turn and how many miles until the next turn. If I’m driving and try to swipe up, oftentimes I accidentally tap the banner, which opens the app. Then I have to pick up my phone while driving and try to switch back to navigation before I miss my turn,and this happens all the time. I want banner notifications but not permanently. 

The other gripe I have is the audio notification. If you are talking on the phone and someone sets off the motion detector, it notifies you over your conversation and you miss everything that was just said. If someone God forbid rings the doorbell afterwards, you miss even more of the conversation. I’m in sales so it has hit me at a few crucial times. Me: “so what kind of budget are we working with?” Customer: “well we really like what we see so we desigMOTION DETECTED AT YOUR FRONT DOOR and I think we will be able to commit to DING DONG will that work?

After investing more money into the chime, my wifi connection no longer disconnects but the live video feed is choppy as all can get. I have fiber optic internet and never have a problem with any of my devices, ONLY the ring doorbell. I hate the quality i get for how much money i put into this system.

Always the same box truck or fire truck, it’s consistent at least... the spot light cam has more customization in regards to the customizable area that you can set where it picks up motion. The doorbell cam is too simple and not customizable enough which is weird because naturally that’s where more vehicle movement will be.. the flood light cam was worth every penny even though I can only use on about 25% sensitive due to said issues, it still picks up everything I need. The doorbell cam I’ve actually considered removing other then it offers one simple function, when someone rings I can talk to them. Other then that I’ve turned it’s sensitivity all the way down on the doorbell, I don’t need to know every time a box truck or the mail man goes by. 

All in all the floodlight cam is worth the money! The doorbell would probably be worth it if you lived in a quit neighborhood will low traffic. I would also love if the loading time to get into the camera after it spots motion would speed up, sometimes it takes up to 30+ seconds before my view of the live footage is available.

The camera is good on the videos when you go back to view, but this is my issue. The live view is not great, in & out, stalls, video drags. Also, at night the alerts go off constantly on some evenings. When i view, there is absolutely nothing there. I have it on the least sensitivity (people only), yet still goes off all the time, especially when it rains.
Then I have the original video doorbell. I hate that thing. Battery is dead after a week with almost no use, but i could live with that if it worked properly. Works maybe 10% of the time. Most of the time I get a black screen on the videos. It is installed properly, Has good connection. Yet I’ll get an alert and when I view the video, yep just a total black screen throughout the entire video.
Now let me end with saying there is nothing wrong my connectivity. I have very good speed (pay for the highest my cable company offers), and the app shows good connectivity. I wanted to get others for my side/back, but very hesitant. I also like that they now have the home security, but again very hesitant.

I’m getting forced logouts constantly, which is not good when you need to answer an alarm.  Then, recently, when I tried to exercise options during viewing, which you are supposed to be able to do, it started eliminating a whole series of videos, or freezing them.  These are glitches that need to be fixed by developers, but I’ve been waiting a couple of months, already, and these issues still exist.  I think they need new, or more developers, and deal better with expansion of their client base. Very recently, another “quirk” is now occurring: when I try to answer an event, Ring won’t let me see it; it’s just added to the dashboard.

In fact they would probably never turn on if I didn’t delete all the schedules. So now I just manually turn motion on and off until there’s a fix. Everyone seems to be having problems since the latest update.
UPDATE: I got help from their support team. What I did and I believe it worked was delete the app. Reboot the phone and then installed the app again. So video alerts are working fine and since I got my RSSI to about-42 it works really good. 
Another update: ok I’ve got the same problem again. The schedules seemed to work until a certain day. Like one other review said it seems that days are off. So if you schedule your device to not alert you on a certain day it will likely turn off the day before you had it scheduled. So until they fix this I will have to not use the scheduled alerts.

While my home is very modern, it is very old and never had a door bell.  Ring doesn’t tell you, even with the app, if users do not have an existing door bell they will have to buy a chime, and external power pack from Ring.  Oh boy, more money to spend and more time to wait on using something you purchase! Another thing they do not tell you, the thing quits working if someone rings your door bell. Apparently a common issue if you bothers to read feedback comments on here. 

To reset it, users must unplug the “Ring power pack “, wait a minute or so and then plug it back in.  Very much rendering it useless and time consuming.  In addition they do not tell you the lag time it takes the app to open and show video if someone does ring the bell or sets off the alert, plus they have this new feature that makes even that more complicated by opening in past time forcing the user to advance to live.  Now, I’ve change my internet provider and have no way of changing my WiFi setting in the App and when I pull the stinking cover and push the rest it never shows in my WiFi as an available connection so I can add it to my WiFi

Motion lights flicker. Annoying and can’t figure out why.  Videos are good but if you’re trying to identify someone, good luck! Too grainy.

Finally, the app doesn’t allow me to pause notifications for more than 4 hours at a time (iPhone). This is quite annoying.

The problem with Ring is 1.) they ALWAYS promise features and updates that never show up. For example, If you own an iOS device and keep falling for Ring’s baloney “we are working on HomeKit” story just keep in mind they’ve literally been saying that for almost three years and they haven’t even been testing HomeKit in public beta yet so it’s not showing up anytime soon. 2.) The most important function of the camera is the ability to quickly access the video when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell. For some reason, whenever either of those events happens, the live video freezes up and won’t let you access it. I believe this is because the camera starts automatically recording (which is good), but it’s incapable of recording and letting you access the live feed at the same time. It’s extremely inconsistent. What is the point of this if you don’t get to see and talk to the person until two mins after the event? So bad. And it’s NOT my internet connection.

Unlike the advertisement on television where there is a perfect image day or night of people trespassing and talking to you through the ring doorbell but in reality that is a lie you cannot see people clearly like that and then the mic is not that clear either when talking to someone.
And We just don’t understand why there is an option for the sensor to span out to 30 feet when you can only see a bunch of pixel images or face. Were is the security protection in that?

It is now charging at door but wireless signal is poor. The reset made it work briefly then now it's back to poor signal and can't view device. Even when you can get a view on the camera it is very delayed and pixelated. I have 3 other camera none of which are having issue. The other camera devices were acquired prior to ring and considering switching if this is NOT fixed ASAP. Just wanted to warn everyone prior to agreeing to update. Is this an attempt for the company to try to get users to buy new devices....sort of like apple slowing down iPhones.. just wondering...

44,Bonded & Secured,False,2021-09-12 07:08:05,This App is absolutely HORRIBLE!,1,"First the video of clearer than other cameras I have. Finally & most importantly, this app is awesome if you randomly want to get no sleep.
At this moment,  the notifications are coming every 2 to 4 minutes (LITERALLY) with the sensitivity set to minimum and my zone set to cover barely anything.I just snooze notifications.
So… I have the Ring floodlight camera. Initially the cars going past were what was setting it off even with the temporary subscription. 
Last complaint: I did NOT purchase the subscription because I was disappointed that I was not aware I needed something separate before I bought this. At the time my other cameras from their competitor was NOT like that. I saw it as greedy money grubbing when they could have just included a reasonable subscription in the price. Who besides me wants the camera without at least being able to see the video for 1 day, 1 minute, 1 second? It is ridiculous and makes no sense to sell you something with that price tag & such high expectations that you will NOT be able to use for it’s intended purpose … except I have another security system and mainly needed the motion detection floodlight (which by the way, flicks my neighbor every 2 -4 minutes at night)… Wish you well with that.",

I loved this app and device when we first bought it and recommend it to many friends. For the past six months or more, it lags like crazy. I thought maybe it is my WiFi but after reading reviews (and checking my WiFi setup and speeds many times), I’m convinced it’s an app problem. I have turned my app notifications off for the last 3 months because it does me no good to get a doorbell notice and not be able to respond to someone at my door because it’s refreshing and unable to catch up. By the time the video starts playing the person is gone or leaving...same with motion detector mode. I also receive notice about an update for the app every time I open the app but the app seems unable to update—starts and never completes. I have an iPhone X with newest updates so it’s not because my phone is too old. This app is not well supported on the development side. Needs to improve or this product will go away. I’m currently looking for a better alternative. Disappointed because I was completely sold on this product and was considering expanding into the other products until it went downhill.

The app on the other hand, which is what this review is about, has gotten progressively more complex, annoying and cumbersome.  Internal ads (for “new features”) distract from real camera views.  You told us once about modes and motion verification, we don’t need to see a reminder about the “great new features” every time we open the app.  The device settings screen now has more tiles than fit on the screen without scrolling.  Either organize this stuff better or let us remove things we don’t personally need - for me it would be “mode settings”, “linked devices”, and “shared users”, for others might be something else.
And the message to “Add a Ring solar panel to Extend Battery Life” (their caps not mine) continues to appear for cameras *which have a solar panel attached*.  Is there anything more useless than that?
If this keeps up, after another few updates I’ll revise this review down to two stars.  It’s a shame, you’d think they could afford to hire app developers who have some sense.",

Today I went to the website and changed my password. After changing out the website immediately logged me out, so I logged back in using the new password. Everything worked as I expected. Then I opened the app on my iPhone and it also asked me to log in again. I tried repeatedly, but consistently was told “invalid credentials” and after a few tries got a new email asking about the failed logins. So I logged into the website again, with no problem.

After thinking about the situation I decided to try a different password, one with no special characters in it. Now I can log into both the website and the app. Why do you accept a different set of characters in the passwords used on the website and app if you’re going to share the same password between them???

For what it’s worth, the characters ^$@! work on both. On the web you can use an asterisk (*) in your password, but then you won’t be able to log into the app. Why do you permit that without a warning?",

The voice function is worse and barely audible, it has large gaps and delays and sometimes just doesn’t pick up a thing for hours. It is vital for us to have this work for protection of our Airbnb guests and our property.  It seems that almost every time we’ve caught something that needs reported to Airbnb the video stops working and won’t pick up a good portion of it.  Recently we had an attempted break in and our front door lock ruined.  The ring picked up the activity around 10 pm with showed them messing with the door but then the ring had a long gap of no activity and it never picked up them leaving or any further activity until some dog ran through the property 4 hours later.  So much for security.  We’ve lost income due to the ring not functioning like it should because Airbnb won’t reimburse without a video or picture.  
The first ring never shut up &  captured every fly or moth but had a good picture and voice.  This new ring just times out of the blue, delays to record before or after, the picture isn’t as clear as the first one and just got forget being able to hear any voices clearly.",

I wanted to be alerted when there was a motion and to share the video with authorities and neighbors when needed.  This night video is a complete joke.  The video is pink when it should be black and white. (Google “Ring pink video”) I’m not asking for clear color at night. But the option to manually set color or black and white would be great. At least black and white.  I opted for a real 4K security camera with a built in microphone and records to an as card. No monthly/yearly cloud storage which ring banks on again. It also alerts me via mobile app of any motion and allows me to save crystal clear video and audio to my phone for sharing. I’ll use the ring to scream at them seems to be all it’s good for. Their support is also worthless. Asking for tons of info and never getting the issue resolved.

First of all, it was well into February before we could even use it as it was “too cold” where we live!  After the weather warmed up to an acceptable temp, we tried again.  The Ring doorbell is supposed to be designed to NOT pick up vehicles, except for very large ones, however, on multiple occassions delivery people and solicitors have walked all the way up to our door and left before it ever picks them up, and we can pull into our driveway and pass the front of the house before it alerts, yet every single vehicle that passes on the road is picked up??  It has become so unreliable that it is of no comfort knowing we have it.  The only thing that works reliably is the doorbell feature, I didn’t pay $200 for a bell !!!   On the occassion it actually records activity, in the daylight, it is bright white for several seconds before the camera focuses, so by the time it engages, all you see is the person’s back as they are walking away!

53,MariaOka,False,2021-07-06 23:38:54,Still bugs to fix,3,"The app works great for most Ring devices, but still lacks support others like the Ring Transformer for landscape lights. For example, the app allows you to group Ring outdoor cameras with the Transformer in a single lighting group, which enables the Transformer to light up when motion is detected on the camera. This is a really handy feature that allows you to coordinate all of your lights on the camera’s motion detector. However, the camera’s lights automatically turn off after a short time and, when they do this, they also force the Transformer to turn off the landscape lights, thus overriding whatever turn-off schedule you have set for them in the app.

This is clearly a flaw.  The app should prioritize the lifting schedule first and the landscape lights should only turn off and on with the camera OUTSIDE of the hours it is already scheduled to be turned on. Ring should fix this bug or, alternatively, give the user more options for specifying when the Transformer should respond to the motion detected on the camera.

The fact that this bug exists makes the Transformer feel like an orphaned product.",

But what I don’t like is that Ring decided to change things and NOT let anyone know what they were going to change.  My MAJOR issue is with the dashboard preview.  Before this I could be in “Home” mode and I could use the preview to look what was going on around my house and also to check how my son was doing playing outside(He is 8 and we have an enclosed property).   Now I have to either change the Mode to “Away” and trigger the motion sensors and have my entire house chiming just to either see what’s going on around my house or to just check on my son.  
The ring app for my family and I WAS perfect!  It was to use and espically how USER FRIENDLY it was!  I hope that Ring will change that what they did with that “Home” feature and let us just open the app and there would be a few screens showing what was going on outside.

It takes forever to perform common tasks. I should be able to view and modify which sensors are active in which mode directly from the dashboard. The mode buttons are RIGHT THERE. No, they want me to be sure so they made the process take 95 steps. And how come I can’t change the chimes for the entire system? It had to be individually? Really!? I have 14 windows and 3 doors in my house. For heavens sake. The activity logs are individual as well. And please don’t get me wrong there should be an option to view each sensor’s log individually but it would be extremely convenient to be able to view a list, and to sort for what I need.

I rarely get push notifications about a low battery till I pull the app up and then all the sudden a notification comes through (yes push is enabled and background app refresh). Since Ring has opened this to the public, even without ring, it’s a joke. I get daily neighborhood notifications from the paranoid recluses that live in bomb shelters. They post comments like “the leaves on my tree were moving but there was no wind”. People now are posting videos of solicitors. Not to mention when something’s actually happening people don’t post cross streets or a general vicinity so somewhere in my 12 sq mile neighborhood somethings happening. I use to appreciate the helpful videos with actual crime prevention. Now I have to shut off these notifications because they are so frequent. This started great and is just going down hill.

In the past several months “protests” have come very close to our home. Family and friends nearby have experienced property damage, theft, threats and intimidation from “protestors.” Around the country violent and aggressive groups are taking their activities into residential neighborhoods. Around 12:30am a couple nights ago a vehicle with a bullhorn drove down our street. We woke up, but I didn’t catch what they said. All I caught was the word “incomng.” I went to the ring app and posted an “unusual activity” asking if anyone heard what they said because I was afraid for my family given ongoing tensions. I received a notification the next day that staff decided my post wasn’t of interest to neighbors and deleted it. I responded upset saying I was concerned for my family’s safety.

Notifications stopped coming to my phone altogether. My chime pro failed. What’s the point of a video doorbell that doesn’t notify you when someone is ringing it? Ring needs to halt all new product development and put all effort toward fixing their buggy software. The core experience is broken. 

Old review: As others have said Ring needs to work on the core experience of using the app before adding features. When you click a notification or answer the doorbell it is a minimum of 10+ seconds before you get a picture. I always find that I can just walk to the door faster than I can load and connect to the Ring app. I have an iPhone XS Max and 150mbit fiber with Ubiquity WiFi so I know the lag isn’t due to my hardware or connection. This core experience is one of the most important parts of the product and Ring needs to improve it before I can really recommend their cameras. The slow response time really makes the doorbell and cameras pretty useless for any real time monitoring and communication. The recorded video and motion detection parts work well, but Ring markets these things for their real time functions and that part doesn’t work very well.",

Finally instead of shipping me another camera and me turning this one back in so they can troubleshoot or whatever they gotta do.

My wife has the primary account, and I have the shared account. We need separate accounts because we have very different notification settings. However, as the primary, she has more options than I do. For example, she can get low battery notifications and I can’t. But I’ll change the batteries. How does this make sense? Our schedules are different and her work is demanding, so the fact that I can’t receive those notifications is an inconvenience at best. I also can’t add devices as a shared user. I have to log into the app as my wife to do so. If having a primary user is a security thing, why does ring keep suggesting I log in with her email and password? So while the app can be problematic, the root cause may be that the design of the system having a single primary is flawed, and it makes the app look bad. But like I said, despite these issues, at least we have security that works. That does improve the app score though. I’m tempted to add a star because what functions in the app does a good job...but I’ve been so aggregated with Ring after spending close to $1000 that I can’t bring myself to be that gracious.",

The majority of the time I have a black screen.  I’ve only been able to see a live view maybe 3 times.  Let’s just say 5 to give the benefit of the doubt.  I’ve been paying the monthly fee despite all this hoping things would get better.  For the past 2 weeks my doorbell and chime extender have been offline and I have tried numerous times to reset them. I’ve reset my internet (which works fine with everything else I need in the home) and there’s still no change.  Finally I’m giving up and I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone.  Maybe the Ring Pro would work better for me, but I’m not taking any chances.  It’s just not worth my time or my money.  I am highly disappointed.  I wish I had just returned it in the beginning like I started to.",

After going around and around with customer service they say its the app itself ( contact apple ) or my internet ( which is working FINE for all other devices ).. Customer service basically said sorry its not the system its your app or internet. But doesnt this system work hand in hand with the app?? Wasn’t that the whole purpose?!?! Just an I’m sorry is not what I’d expect after reading  the inventors story on the packaging.. you can’t see anything else on the app without setting up an acct so how do you get help with the app??

It seemed like the solution to our security worries with the ability to screen visitors via video. We have have super high speed internet and the ring chime. And we all have the same problem.
Despite having fully lit hallways, the video is in black and white. Basically, it’s stuck in night mode. Only 5% of the videos are in color. One neighbor thought the night vision view was normal and was shocked to see color one day.
This creates multiple problems. The red LED lights come on every single time and the device clicks to indicate that it is recording. The video is basically garbage as we were promised high quality color. The battery drains quicker because of this.
This problem is well documented (google it) and common among ring users. We have all tried customer support and while they have been responsive, we still don’t have a solution despite multiple factory resets and replacement units.
This problem could BE EASILY SOLVED if they just added the ability to turn off night vision. I cannot understand why this simple solution cannot be implemented immediately. What use is this if the thing doesn’t even basically work.","{'id': 5361977, 'body': 'Hi NYC Apartment, \n\nThis should not be the case.

In addition, we recommended this product to multiple friends, family & neighbors, who in turn also purchased one. However, after this update, the video does not work and after contacting customer support they told me I’d have to take off the cover and reset the doorbell and start from scratch as we initially did at installation. Since we can’t locate the special screwdriver enclosed with the installation box, this is not possible. Would have been helpful with all the guides included in the box if it was noted, “Don’t lose this tiny obscure screwdriver or you will not be able to reset your doorbell video camera each time we update the app.”
Update: After contacting Ring about a replacement screwdriver, they shipped one to me and it arrived today. I was able to recalibrate the doorbell and as of now, it seems to be working.

69,RLMSR,False,2018-03-20 15:21:06,Really disappointed,2,"My daughter purchased the ring doorbell for us for Christmas and were excited to install it. We were all very disgusted when we found out that we had to pay for a yearly subscription to use the doorbell after the first month. Nothing on the packaging said anything about this being the case. We did pay for this year but will not renew because we are finding it to be very unreliable. When there is a ring or motion, the first thing you see is a white light that lasts around 10 seconds. When the light goes away, usually there is nothing there. We live in a quiet neighborhood and a car goes by maybe once an hour. We live around 30 feet from the road and the only thing we can see are the garbage trucks stopping once a week. If someone is walking by the house, it doesn’t record that. If someone is walking or parking in our driveway, it doesn’t record that either. We have it set up for all the “zones” and it doesn’t record most of them. I was snow blowing our sidewalk right in front of the ring doorbell one day. I went to check if it was recorded and it wasn’t! Have had several people ask us how we like it and have told them how disappointed we were.",
70,elpedro174,False,2021-11-05 12:51:08,Decent app with some confusing hierarchy and missing features.,3,"First of all, this is a fairly rich app that’s updated regularly, which is great. The downside is that the the organization of all the features is pretty poor in that I often find myself having to spend a significant amount of time tapping through seemingly endless menus in various locations within the app trying to find a setting. It’s frustrating.

The other big problem is that despite there being many settings for my cameras that I’d probably never need or use, there are some pretty significant holes in those features as well. For example, there is surprisingly no ability to set a camera to run the siren automatically when motion or a person is detected, which seems like a baseline security feature to me. I have a camera set up in an area of my building that no one should be entering ever, but in order to set the siren when someone enters, I’d have to catch the motion notification and manually press the siren button, which pretty much defeats the purpose of a security camera with a siren built in, no?",

I have fast internet at home and 5G phone service and when I go to arm my cameras or check an alert, I only get a message saying that it’s “taking longer than expected.” Yep, anything longer than a couple of seconds is longer than expected! It should be ready basically as soon as I click on it! Even if the app stays open on my phone this is happening. It makes the service pointless all around if you can’t get to it when you need it. It struggles to get to a screen to arm and forget about checking an alert that something is happening in real time. You can’t view it or get the app to do anything to even get the saved video to load. What am I paying for??

Also, the app keeps trying to open neighborhood area notifications and goes to random posts. I even arrow back, and it opens it again; it takes 3-4 times of this back and forth nonsense to get back to the Home Screen. Very frustrating. Please redo this app! A year ago it was just fine. 

If the app is fixed, I’ll update this review. So if you’re reading this, consider it faulty still.",

We’re they deleted anyway, even though I was told there was a problem, they would not be deleted? Are they still floating in the cloud somewhere? The cameras are activating way too late, or sometimes not at all. For instance it takes my mail carriers 10 seconds to reach my mailbox (by my front door) from the time they get into detecting range. Half the time I only get to see them when they’re already 10’ away again, after putting whatever into my mailbox. That means that someone could walk right up to my camera, having been in detection range for 10 seconds or more) and blind it with a piece of black tape, and I’ll never have a record of any of it, let alone of what happens afterwards. Starting to look like a big waste of money. And the Rapid Ring takes way too long to activate also.",

Device crashes. 10 minutes trying to reconnect and go live, nothing but “streaming error, try again”. It’s not my home wifi which is top notch 200+ Mbps at points much farther away than the Ring, which isn’t reporting connection issues until it’s time for it to do something.  

A ring doorbell came with the house I bought over a year ago. The app has gotten progressively worse during that time. At first I would get notifications, click them, app opens, camera view comes right up. Several updates and added features later, the app is nearly useless for live views. Tells me it’s activating device, but more than half the time now it never activates. App developers are always iterating and using agile methods to add new junk and it often results in weakening the basic core functionality that users want. I’d much prefer an app that simply lets me see my front door when the camera notices motion - period, than motion zones, human detection, snapshots, etc. It’s gotten so bad I’ve about overcome inertia and am ready to replace Ring with something else.",

If I click on a motion alert notification it takes me to a live view. I doubt you could retrieve a live view through WiFi any faster than it currently provides. If your WiFi or connection is slow, then it won’t be the apps fault. I do wish they’d keep Rapid Ring active and supported for just basic camera operation. Hopefully that’ll change. I kinda wish they had an indoor mode so outdoor and indoor cameras were on a separate system, but that a minor issue really. I also wish there was a way to delete videos in bulk. I had several this morning of random walkers/joggers that I could have just deleted with one click, but I have to individually delete them. Otherwise I’ve not had any real problems with the system.",

This is a 2nd home for us and we do short term rentals. Being 1000 miles away I have been able to lock the doors remotely because a tenant left it unlock or know when the windows has been opened and let the housekeeper know to check to make sure they are locked when they clean the home.

The live view never connects when I need it to. It takes about 3 or 4 minutes and multiple app restarts to connect if it decides to connect at all. I have 250mbps internet and the modem is not that far away from the door where the ring is. It’s honestly caused more of an annoyance than anything. Having a video door bell doesn’t do much good if I can’t connect to it when someone is at the door. 

I’ve been using Ring since July of this year (2018) and have had to recharge it 4 times already after it draining to critically low. I’ve adjusted every setting and have tried every combination and nothing makes a difference. I still get motion alerts every 5 minutes and the worse part is each motion notification comes twice. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.

Update: September 2019.. Over a year later and if anything the app is even worse. There’s no volume more times than not (assuming live view loads at all).

I mean holy cow it is bad and yes I have called the company & they have tried at times to help but honestly it’s just the product and service are just crap. We got this because we’ve had our vehicles broken into in our home almost broken into three times now &  both of the times that these things happened after we purchased the ring system cameras, it happens not to capture people moving all over the yard which there were four thugs, I mean are you serious?

It’s great that all devices are covered for a great price for an entire year subscription. It is also great that your devices will be replaced if stolen or damaged. The app also needs reconfiguring. It’s a hassle to look through all the devices to get to the one you wish to view. Having to hang up on the live view setting is also a drag. I have nest products and get in, out, and around the app very easily. Customer service is amazing. I have already began purchasing YI products as a back up as they are extremely inexpensive and offer free internal and paid cloud storage options.

Within the app you can change the range the doorbell detects motion and also turn off certain ""zones"" if you feel you don't need to watch that particular area. You can also turn off notifications for both motion and doorbell rings and it will still record. 

As for the customer service at Ring, each rep I've spoken with has gone above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. I have two Ring doorbells and a Chime Pro and am currently looking into their other devices to add to my existing home security. 

If I could change one thing it would be to add the option make motion recording last longer when I haven't answered the alert on time. Maybe a minute vs the 20/30 seconds.",

However the delay with the notification and being able to see a person when I get notified definitely has a delay. The other delay that I find is when I click the live view it always seems to circle until I close it and then re-open it which kind of defeats the purpose of wanting a live you when you sense motion. The other thing that I have to find fault with is when I purchased a new router, you would think the app would allow you to change your Wi-Fi settings on all of your ring devices. However this is not the case at all! In order to change the Wi-Fi setting on the cameras you have to climb up and push the reset button on the top of the camera. I’m not sure about you but when I had it installed up near the top of my roof I never intended on having to climb back up there or have somebody climb back up there to reset it. This is a huge negative and should definitely be something that should be able to be done in the app for all of your cameras.",

The units detect motion of cars moving perpendicular to the camera but rarely detect and / or record anyone walking directly at the cameras.  Alarms go off and yet no video!  Because of delays for video recordings, the intruders in and out are missed completely which seems to be related to alarms (when you get an alarm) with no video.

My husband checked the alert and jumped up from the couch to look outside the window that overlooks our driveway.

Sparks shot from an outside light as smoke rose, obscuring the light and Ring camera. 

The sparks quickly turned into bursts of flames. 

“Call 911!” My husband yelled. 

I ran for my phone and called 911. 

A fire truck rolled into our driveway a short time later as my husband tried to douse the flames with water from a hose.

Within an hour, the fire marshal told us that the fire had been extinguished, contained to an area that abutted the laundry room. An inspection of the house, which included the attic, confirmed that the fire had been isolated to one area of the house.

We were extremely lucky the house didn’t burn down.

If we hadn’t received the Ring alert on our phones that detected motion from the smoke, the outcome would have been the opposite of our good fortune. 

We were able to call 911 within seconds of the alert on our phones. 

Timing is everything in life. We knew within seconds that a fire had started in the wires connected to the outside light.

Had we not acted as quickly as we did, our house would have been engulfed in flames. I’m certain of that.

But, thanks to Ring the fire was quickly contained. It didn’t have time to spread and consume our house.

The service is not terribly expensive at $30/ year BUT if you don’t buy their service the camera is nearly useless.  There is apparently NO local memory on the camera to record even a microsecond of video events. Clearly there MUST be a video buffer that holds the data before it is transferred to Ring’s remote servers. Ring has intentionally prevented consumers from accessing locally recorded content. 😡
   Also, once my trial subscription ran out I suddenly started having connection problems with the device. I would receive notification of motion but then could not open the video camera - it says “temporarily unavailable”. Nothing has changed in the local network and there is NO reason I should suddenly start having this problem. Ring has clearly engineered the device to fail if you don’t give in to their extortion. 
  I know this may sound a little ridiculous over $30/ year but as an engineer I know the company has intentionally designed this device to extort money from consumers and it really makes me mad.

When watching video playback from other people’s post, there is no scrubbing; you cannot fast forward or replay portions of the video. You can only ‘jump’ to sections of the clip. 
Why is this important?  
Because when you watch a video and want to identify a person, their clothing, their actions, their car, etc. you need to be able to replay that specific few seconds of the clip, but you cannot. You have to replay the whole clip or keep jumping to that ‘area’ of the clip. This is not a smooth user experience.
Additionally, maybe it’s my iPhone X or iOS version, but when i get a notification and get redirected to the message board or Live video, It doesn’t load properly unless I exit out and re-navigate to that message board or video shot.

Now I can see a guest user(s) having limited access to the ring devices like for someone going be housekeeping or house sitting, ETC…, but shared users so be allow the same access as the owner account has but of course would be allowed or given such permission by the account holder owner or admin rights, the only thing that the shared users can’t do is add or removed devices to the system, so shared users can be given to family members in the household or if landlord for renters is offering ring devices like the ring alarm system to their rented out properties, to be used….

90,Vizardknight,False,2020-04-24 11:24:37,They work really well,3,"I deducted one star because there is a considerable delay before the re cording starts and if there is continuous motion, it stops recording for a short period, then starts up again.  I have missed a few events due to this delay.  Would be nice to be able to select delay (obviously less delay would use way more battery power).
Second star deducted was for the lack of ability to adjust the motion zones.  Only being able to do a low arch across the bottom of the video is pretty lame.
The video quality is a perfect blend just enough you can zoom in a bit to see a face and low enough to keep the monthly/yearly cost low.
They are pretty reliable.  There have been a couple occasions I could not connect or took a longish time to connect.
The solar panel+Spotlight cam is a perfect combo!  I have two and being completely wireless, these are fantastic, a little pricey but well worth it...If in full facing sun, only need one rechargeable battery, if solar panel is facing north/west in back of house, it’s marginal (due to mostly in shade 1/2 day).

I wish I could adjust the depth of motion sensitivity to EACH zone. As of now, each zone offers only the turn on or turn off feature. Prior to that step it does allow you to backoff the sensitivity to the WHOLE view, but that does not fit well for my needs. Please consider this as a possible feature in your app. BTY I think the black screens (or some that is) could be occurring bc of a delay in WiFi loading the video slowly. I had a black video, could not figure out why. Left it on the app for days, today went back and it finally loaded what was captured. So this told me that the issue maybe with a slow response by my WiFi connection. My guess, I’m not very tech savvy. Hope this helps.",

Love this product! It’s so nice to be able to see who is at your front door before you open it!! The subscription service is a nice option for people who need the ability to watch recordings of who has been at the door. Motion detection could be easier to set up. Not all homes will need the wedge to help keep motion alerts within the alert area. The wedge is really most helpful for areas with status. Where there are no stairs & your door faces the street, the motion feature will send you notifications whenever cars go by. After trying to fix this issue & having no luck, I finally decided to turn off my motion notifications for good. The unit comes with one battery, but I would recommend getting a second for easier use. Here are the features I would like to see added in the future- The ability to silence notifications from specific zones, an in app panic/emergency button & the ability set up a series of recorded messages/other features that would provide users with more ways to respond to doorbell.",

The app is one place where there's something left to be desired. I had Arlo cameras before replacing them with Rings (lag, poor motion detection and battery life were the deciding factors) and their app was far superior. It provided a home screen with thumbnails of the last image captured by each cam, and tapping it started the live view. You then had a timeline of motion events to browse. Best of all were the rules, schedules and geofencing. This is really where Ring is lacking. I'd really like better control over when my cameras are alerting.

This, of course, leaves us with outcomes of false alarms (AGAIN ALL THE TIME). We end up ignoring these alarms, and again, like previously mentioned, another supporting fact that the main point of having these cameras becomes useless! 
👎🏻 One of our cameras powered by solar, suddenly stopped charging the battery.  Solar panel is only about a year old.  The battery was just recently sent as a replacement after I called customer support for the problem.  Replacement did not solve the problem; new battery still doesn’t charge, keeps on losing its power.  I don’t think solar power is scarce where we live especially this summer!

After the 30 days you have to pay to use this device to its fullest potential one again. Within the first 30 days the battery only has to be charged once a month. During the trail period the cost is $5 per month and if you don’t but it after 30 days it drops to $3 per month. After 30 sum days pass by the battery needs to be charged 3 times a week. For no apparent reason it’s all down hill after that. The app targets you to buy a solar panal for it or new battery. I also bought an extra back up battery because it takes about a whole day for it to charge. It’s not a battery issue it’s just becomes useless hardware if you don’t continue to pay for their service. You will also need to buy a new transformer 16 vac/ 30 v because it will burn out the 10v transformer or make it ring funny or have a buzzing noise.

It would be easier to adjust the distance if the actual camera view came up just like it does for the spotlight cam instead of the top view with no camera live view.",

Waiting for the Ring pro with hopes it will improve. If not I’ll be sending everything back. Upset that not only have I spent additional money, but can’t get back the money I paid the electrician to hardwire it. The more I look into this, the more complaints I see about the same thing. I have the Ring doorbell 2 by the way.

Update: Got the Ring Pro and plugged it in about 7 feet from the door. Funny thing was it asked me if I wanted to go ahead with the setup because my connection was good. Tried several times and would not connect to the doorbell. Moved it to an outlet in our laundry room which was an addition to the house so it was closer and it finally worked. It has been working better, but still have trouble with live view occasionally. Giving 3 stars because I feel they should be up front about the fact you need the chime pro and you have to have it very close to the doorbell or nothing works.","{'id': 2241479, 'body': 'Hi FLDeb45,\n\nOh no, I am sorry to hear about this less than excellent Ring experience.

I’m an avid viewer of the device health section in the app..for my cameras .. because I like to keep track of their RSSI .. and how my cameras are receiving signals ..the RSSI values are very important in which you receive alerts and recording on my cameras. If I check them and they are in the green numbers then I will know that I will always get alerts at the time the alert is actually happening. Now the device health section is completely blank.. nothing is showing. That part of the app is the most important part of the app other then viewing images of what your camera is recording. Without that info our cameras is like dead in the water. I can’t even know how my camera battery life it at . I canceled my Protect Plan .. I subscribed to a 1 year but just canceled it .. there is no reason for me to be looking at video recording of recordings that are late because the person is already out of the viewing capture area.  You guys need to fix this fast or you will lose a lot of business,

Equipment etc. loved the app, how it worked on my phone and other devices…. Then the last update - 2-3 weeks ago now? The notifications are useless. Live view is gone.  I have to go INTO the app to see what has or is happening e.v.e.r.y.t.i.m.e!! of course now with a significant delay. … because you know it’s …. processing. What was pretty great has now become almost useless, bothersome, inadequate in too many ways.  What worries me is this … if one single update and can undo… screw up so much … what else don’t we know? How secure or appropriate are a lot of things behind the scenes. 
Lastly, signing up for “updates” on the “live view issue” which took too long for you all to acknowledge … required more information than I should have had to give.  Even then - that too had an error.  The equipment is fine - the user interface the thing that is supposed to make y’all
something best, better, convenient, user friendly, has left far too much to be desired.  If a patch or fix doesn’t come soon.  It’ll be time for us to find other alternatives.",

Now every time I get a motion notification detection the camera can’t even connect to a live view. So if someone is at my door or moving outside my door I can’t open the app to view live. The app shows an error like my internet is not strong enough. I mean it was strong enough to send me a notification of movement! Not to mention if you turn on notifications but you don’t check them for a day (because you know that all the notifications were of you leaving or entering your own house) the app automatically turns off notifications without notifying you. I’m so disappointed with this product. I refuse to pay for a subscription with any company that uses a breakdown in their products to force me into a subscription. On top of all this there are so many articles online about how Ring has had a breakdown in their own security of their customer’s private information. This product is worse than useless. You’d be better to spend the $200 on a guard dog to protect you. At least you’d have a shot of feeling actual safety.,

However, what makes up for it is their customer service. Hands down some of the best tech support I’ve ever received, if not the best. All of the agents I’ve talk to have been very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. They know exactly what to do for each issue, and they make it quick and easy too. Their wait times are never that long, most likely because of how efficient each agent is on the phone. I highly recommend getting yourself a ring. Ik I raved a lot about their customer service, but the actual door bell is genius. Makes sure to change your default password to configure your wireless internet, as that is how it connects. The app is very straight forward, and the GUI is clean and easy to use. Great company, they know what they’re doing.",

That's as low as you can set it. At night it is even worse for some reason. It gotten to the point, I have to cut the switches off at night because they are going off every few minutes. It's here is now way you can sleep like that. The lights are like they are on a timer. They are constantly going on and off. They are on about a minute and then off about a minute. I called Ring support. They told me I needed to lower my RSSI, which I have done to no effect. Customer support is of little help. All they concentrate on is the RSSI's. They even told me because I have a brick house, it made it harder for the signal to pass through. I'm thinking seriously of returning them. It's  pitiful that this is the best Ring can do. Also it takes forever for the app to open to live view. Someone could be in you house before the app evens opens. I would give them a zero if I could.",

The connection to any wireless device can sometimes be a bit delayed, but that may be more due to internet traffic then Ring itself. When connected it works very well. The sensitivity settings are “OK” at best as they seem to be either non-existent, or to darn sensitive, despite your software settings. I have my Ring Doorbell hardwired into the doorbell wiring for power so I can’t speak as to the battery life. As for the App: very well laid out app and pretty simple and easy to use. It stacks up a mountain of detections pretty quickly which you need to delete if you don’t want to have a full storage setting. (NOTE TO THE APP TEAM HERE!!) It would be very helpful, actually extremely helpful if there were a “Delete All” button to delete the recordings of detected movements.

My ring doorbell stopped working and I can’t even get it to work. We’ve had the doorbell for around 3 years, so it should still be working fine. If 3 years is its lifespan, then I don’t recommend their products because that would be a waste of money. Not to mention, their help center on the app is so retarded. I can’t even talk to a real person, even though that’s who they claim you are taking to when you use the live chat.   I was trying to get help, as I was having a difficult time with my ring subscription. Even though I had my payment on auto pay, they made me subscribe manually, which is very strange. Along with this, I can’t even view my recordings from when my subscription was expired, although they still show up on my dashboard. This is somewhat understandable, but they should maybe offer an option to where you can view them (by paying, of course). The camera quality is also crap, I sometimes can’t make out a persons face when I zoom in. Honestly, save yourself the trouble, the money, and the stress.",

I'm having to press the button multiple times like an elevator button , really annoying and not very Apple like. Also we should have the ability to change the specific cam Icon in main menu. I have 2 ring pros and one of them has black cover yet only option is to show silver color on icon. Please fix these issues as I really support you guys and plan on buying more products.

Then after having it a few months, it was cut off only to find out that you need to renew a yearly membership just to view your activity. Ok that’s not much, but disappointing. Haven’t had it too long and it really never works correctly. Either it too sensitive and picks up bugs, wind blowing trees, birds, or cars driving by or it does not pick up motion of anything. No in between. Believe me, I have slightly adjusted settings in every way. I have notifications on banners, everything but I’m not getting notifications until it’s too late. One time a person tried to open my door, by the time I got the microphone up, they were gone and short story it caused me to call the police. Yesterday, my daughter said someone parked in our driveway and walked up to the door. I looked and nothing was there. When I try to open an activity, it sits pending for 2 minutes before I can see. I had my daughter ring bell and it was working. I changed settings to more sensitive, and now I get notifications of windy trees.

Installed it with no problems over my garage door and felt because I had a Wi-Fi extender 15 feet away inside my dining room everything would be great. As long as I was within 10 feet of the device I could get live view. Any further distance away would take a minute for live view. Getting live view from anywhere else in town seemed to be impossible.  At that same time I seem to be developing some recent problems with my internet box.  Talked with the service provider and confirm that my box was about 4 1/2 years old. I took the box and replace it with a 
new one. The results were next to amazing!   All functions happen within moments now. To look at my live view cam at any time of day from anywhere in town has a completion time of three seconds now.

129,CPB145,False,2018-08-05 18:22:28,App vs Hardware,3,"Most people seem to be reviewing the hardware, and not the app...in the App Store. By in large I’ve been very satisfied with the quality of the hardware, although the motion and light sensing on the floodlight cam is a little quirky. 

The app however could certainly use a speed boost. It’s a bit slow to launch, and if there’s an update available it makes being able to quickly open a live feed from a camera even slower, as you now have to dismiss the notification first. 

Ring- most users aren’t opening your app just to play around for fun; they’re opening it because they quickly need to view a camera feed. When a moments passed, its passed, and due to the apps responsiveness, that happens entirely too frequently. With very fast and strong WiFi, and hardwired cameras, there’s no reason it should take more than an instant to view one at any given time, except for sluggish interface. Also, please remove notifications about new updates from the startup screen when launching to someplace else (an icon within the app?)",

More so when I’m @ home. Makes me feel safe knowing I can easily scope things out by just opening the app. 1 of the downsides tho  is the footage, whether it be live or old, will freeze a lot. You will see a person at your front door or wherever & then it freezes & next thing you know they’re almost all the way down your driveway ready to turn the corner. Or you see your neighbor outside or a car pulling in & it won’t catch that. Most of the time it will but there’s been many times where I know I left at a certain time but it never shows me leaving. Also I wish it would not delete footage. I just became aware of this. The videos only stay on your ring app for 60 days I believe it is & then they’re gone for good.

I’ve been looking at and studying other cameras and their software such as with ADT and Arlo and I’m telling you right now if Ring don’t get their app fixed for the money we all spend for the equipment and service: they will lose me as a customer very soon.

I don’t know because it doesn’t say in the update what was done and what was fixed. Therapist worked well for most of the time I’ve used it so there’s nothing really to comment bad only the fact that when something goes wrong you’re not told what got fixed and you have to go back and turn on things such as rich notifications again and see if it starts getting double and triple rare’s.

By then I’m out of my lift chair (which is slow in itself), hanging on to my walker and oxygen and about to open the door when the app rings. This is supposed to make my life easier?

It does a good job of recording video and alerting me of motion as well as when I get a visitor. The app works pretty well for the most part but it is a little buggy. 

My biggest complaint is the new neighborhoods feature. As of right now the app will not let me silence the alerts so I’m constantly being bombarded with notifications. The neighborhood section also doesn’t load so I can’t even see what the alert was about. It doesn’t help that the alert noise is a barking dog which is not what I need to hear constantly going off and it’s doesn’t help that it makes my dogs go off as well. 

I would say that right now Ring needs to take one step back from physical product creation and throw a little bit more effort in software and app UX/UI. It doesn’t matter how great the physical product is if the software on the backend and the app on the front end doesn’t do what it needs to do.",

There is currently no way to do this. Even if you set a schedule to not alert you, the device still records movement and fills up events which makes it hard to find a true event (you just don’t receive the notification), but the recording is still active. It would be great if they came up with a feature like home security systems where you can set them to  “HOME” or “AWAY”. This way if you set it to HOME, no alerts and no recordings happen. Otherwise every single thing is recorded. We have tried getting around this by turning the devices off when we have family events, but you can’t turn off some of the devices (like doorbells). This is very annoying!!!! Please come up with a way to turn all systems off when you need or want to. Other than that, I am happy with the devices. We have 2 doorbells, and 3 floodlight cams.",

We should have an option to shut that off and go directly to the old VERY USEFUL screen that is now buried under extra clicks.  Also, The zoom function no longer works on live camera making that useless as well.  Plus when I hit “go live” it just spins and spins and the cameras take forever to load.  I tried changing it to the other setting to automatically go live and that spins also.  By the time anything does load many minutes later, if there was someone on my property, at my door or stealing a package, whatever, they are long gone.  Basically the app update has rendered my doorbell and cameras totally useless. And that really angers me given how much we’ve spent on cameras and security system to guard our house.

We CALLED immediately so their IT department could pull the video off their servers (working in IT we are well aware servers don’t continuously dump data, it updates at a scheduled time daily!).

Detecting way too much initially, but appropriately as I had set too very sensitive with a wide zone.  Turned it down to near least sensitive and shrunk the zone to avoid street traffic, fix it.

My problem with the app is that despite snoozing and turning of ring/motion alerts it will still manage to log activity at times.
