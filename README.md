# appstore-scraper

Using a simple to use library, created appstore reviews scraper. For now fetched 2000 reviews for amazon ring app, will do the same for some other apps later.
Objective is to perform topic modelling on the store reviews so that development team can find actionable reviews. For example when a new update is rolled out and someone complains tey are not able to login , a support team can immediately reach out and resolve the issue. Seperating positive reviews and generic negative reviews will give clearer picture of a products current stature.

Will update with topic modelling code soon
